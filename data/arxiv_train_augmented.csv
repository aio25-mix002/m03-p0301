"  We present an improved calculation of higher-order corrections to the
one-loop self energy of 2P states in hydrogen-like systems with small nuclear
charge Z. The method is based on a division of the integration with respect to
the photon energy into a high- and a low-energy part. The high-energy part is
calculated by an expansion of the electron propagator in powers of the Coulomb
field. The low-energy part is simplified by the application of a
Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. This transformation leads to a clear
separation of the leading contribution from the relativistic corrections and
removes higher order terms. The method is applied to the 2P_{1/2} and 2P_{3/2}
states in atomic hydrogen. The results lead to new theoretical values for the
Lamb shifts and the fine structure splitting.

"  We study the performance of two different electrode models in quantum
transport calculations based on density functional theory: Parametrized Bethe
lattices and quasi-one dimensional wires or nanowires. A detailed account of
implementation details in both cases is given. From the systematic study of
nanocontacts made of representative metallic elements, we can conclude that
parametrized electrode models represent an excellent compromise between
computational cost and electronic structure definition as long as the aim is to
compare with experiments where the precise atomic structure of the electrodes
is not relevant or defined with precision. The results obtained using
parametrized Bethe lattices are essentially similar to the ones obtained with
quasi one dimensional electrodes for large enough sections of these, adding a
natural smearing to the transmission curves that mimics the true nature of
polycrystalline electrodes. The latter are more demanding from the
computational point of view, but present the advantage of expanding the range
of applicability of transport calculations to situations where the electrodes
have a well-defined atomic structure, as is case for carbon nanotubes, graphene
nanoribbons or semiconducting nanowires. All the analysis is done with the help
of codes developed by the authors which can be found in the quantum transport
toolbox Alacant and are publicly available.

"  The ultimate performance - ratio of electrical conductivity to optical
absorbance - of single- walled carbon nanotube (SWCNTs) transparent conductive
films (TCFs) is an issue of considerable application relevance. Here, we
present direct experimental evidence that SWCNT bundling is detrimental for
their performance. We combine floating catalyst synthesis of non-bundled,
high-quality SWCNTs with an aggregation chamber, in which bundles with mean
diameters ranging from 1.38 to 2.90 nm are formed from identical 3 microns long
SWCNTs. The as-deposited TCFs from 1.38 nm bundles showed sheet resistances of
310 Ohms/sq. at 90% transparency, while those from larger bundles of 1.80 and
2.90 nm only reached values of 475 and 670 Ohms/sq., respectively. Based on
these observations, we elucidate how networks formed by smaller bundles perform
better due to their greater interconnectivity at a given optical density.
Finally, we present a semi-empirical model for TCF performance as a function of
SWCNT mean length and bundle diameter. This gives an estimate for the ultimate
performance of non-doped, random network mixed-metallicity SWCNT TCFs at ~80
Ohms/sq. and 90% transparency.

"  We perform numerical simulations of impulsively generated Alfv\'en waves in
an isolated photospheric flux tube, and explore the propagation of these waves
along such magnetic structure that extends from the photosphere, where these

shells. Our model of the solar atmosphere is constructed by adopting the
temperature distribution based on the semi-empirical model and specifying the
curved magnetic field lines that constitute the magnetic flux tube which is
rooted in the solar photosphere. The evolution of the solar atmosphere is
described by 3D, ideal magnetohydrodynamic equations that are numerically
solved by the FLASH code. Our numerical simulations reveal, based on the
physical properties of the multi-shell magnetic twisters and the amount of
energy and momentum associated with them, that these multi-shell magnetic
twisters may be responsible for the observed heating of the lower solar corona
and for the formation of solar wind. Moreover, it is likely that the existence
of these twisters can be verified by high-resolution observations.

"  Natural images are generated under many factors, including shape, pose,
illumination etc. Most existing ConvNets formulate object recognition from
natural images as a single task classification problem, and attempt to learn
features useful for object categories, but invariant to other factors of
variation as much as possible. These architectures do not explicitly learn
other factors, like pose and lighting, instead, they usually discard them by
pooling and normalization. In this work, we take the opposite approach: we
train ConvNets for object recognition by retaining other factors (pose in our
case) and learn them jointly with object category. We design a new multi-task
leaning (MTL) ConvNet, named disentangling CNN (disCNN), which explicitly
enforces the disentangled representations of object identity and pose, and is
trained to predict object categories and pose transformations. We show that
disCNN achieves significantly better object recognition accuracies than AlexNet
trained solely to predict object categories on the iLab-20M dataset, which is a
large scale turntable dataset with detailed object pose and lighting
information. We further show that the pretrained disCNN/AlexNet features on
iLab- 20M generalize to object recognition on both Washington RGB-D and
ImageNet datasets, and the pretrained disCNN features are significantly better
than the pretrained AlexNet features for fine-tuning object recognition on the
ImageNet dataset.

a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) consisting of three active magnetic layers.
For this tri-layer structure, in addition to a conventional bilayer orthogonal
MTJ containing a perpendicular free layer and an in-plane fixed layer, a second
perpendicular layer has been introduced. We found that the microwave emission
frequency induced by spin-transfer torque (STT) can reach as high as 6 GHz in
the absence of any applied magnetic field. Moreover, microwave emission is
observed for both current polarizations where a redshift is seen with increase
in magnitude of current. We discuss spin-dynamics of the observed

"  We have observed the continuum emission of the interacting galaxy NGC4631 at
0.87 and 1.23mm using the Heinrich-Hertz-Telescope on Mt. Graham and the IRAM
30-m telescope on Pico Veleta. We have obtained fully sampled maps which cover
the optical emission out to a radius of about 7' at both wavelengths. For a
detailed analysis, we carefully subtracted the line contributions and
synchrotron and free-free emission from the data, which added up to 6% at
1.23mm and 10% at 0.87mm. We combined the flux densities with FIR data to
obtain dust spectra and calculate dust temperatures, absorption cross sections,
and masses. Assuming a ``standard'' dust model, which consists of two
populations of big grains at moderate and warm temperatures, we obtained
temperatures of 18K and 50K for the both components. However, such a model
suffers from an excess of the radiation at 1.23mm, and the dust absorption
cross section seems to be enhanced by a factor 3 compared to previous results
and theoretical expectations. At large galactocentric radii, where the galaxy
shows disturbances as a result of gravitational interaction, this effect seems
to be even stronger. Some possibilities to resolve these problems are
discussed. The data could be explained by a very cold dust component at a
temperature of 4-6K, an increased abundance of very small grains, or a
component of grains with unusual optical properties. We favour the latter
possibility, since the first two lead to inconsistencies.

"  A regular approach to accounting for initial correlations, which allows to go
beyond the unrealistic random phase (initial product state) approximation in
deriving the evolution equations, is suggested. An exact homogeneous equation
for a two-time equilibrium correlation function for the dynamical variables of
a subsystem interacting with a boson field (heat bath) is obtained. No
conventional approximation like RPA or Bogoliubov's principle of weakening of
initial correlations is used. The obtained equation takes into account the
initial correlations in the kernel governing its evolution. The solution to
this equation is found in the second order of the kernel expansion in the
electron-phonon interaction, which demonstrates that generally the initial
correlations influence the correlation function's evolution in time. It is
shown that this influence vanishes on a large timescale. The developed approach
is applied to the Fr\""ohlich polaron and the low-temperature polaron mobility
(which was under a long-time debate) is found with a correction due to initial

"  We study the spin transport in the low temperature regime (often referred to
as the precession-dominated regime) between a ferromagnetic Fermi liquid (FFL)
and a normal metal metallic Fermi liquid (NFL), also known as the F/N junction,
which is considered as one of the most basic spintronic devices. In particular,
we explore the propagation of spin waves and transport of magnetization through
the interface of the F/N junction where nonequilibrium spin polarization is
created on the normal metal side of the junction by electrical spin injection.
We calculate the probable spin wave modes in the precession-dominated regime on
both sides of the junction especially on the NFL side where the system is out
of equilibrium. Proper boundary conditions at the interface are introduced to
establish the transport of the spin properties through the F/N junction. A
possible transmission conduction electron spin resonance (CESR) experiment is
suggested on the F/N junction to see if the predicted spin wave modes could
indeed propagate through the junction. Potential applications based on this
novel spin transport feature of the F/N junction are proposed in the end.

"  ISOCAM extragalactic mid-infrared deep surveys have detected a population of
strong IR emitters ten times more numerous than expected if there were no
evolution from z<0.2 (IRAS) up to the maximum redshift of these galaxies
(z=1.5). The mid-IR cosmic background produced by these galaxies (2.35+/-0.8 nW
m^-2 sr^-1, at 15 microns above 50 microJy) is larger than 30 per cent of the
energy radiated in the I band by the optical galaxies detected in the HDF,
which are two orders of magnitude more numerous. This fraction is much higher
than in the local universe (z<0.2) as probed by IRAS, where all integrated IR
emission from 8 to 1000 microns makes 30 per cent of the optical starlight.
Even assuming a conservative SED, they produce a major contribution to the 140
mu m DIRBE background measured by Hauser et al. (1998, 25.1+/-7 nW m^-2 sr^-1)
and Lagache et al. (1999, 15.3+/-9.5 nW m^ -2 sr^-1). This is both a
confirmation of the strong IR cosmic background that was first detected by
Puget et al. (1996) and the first identification of the galaxies responsible
for a large fraction of this background at 140 microns. We find that these
bright (several 10^11 Lsol) and massive (<M>= 1.5x10^11 Msol) IR galaxies have
a typical redshift of z=0.7 and optical colors similar to field galaxies. The
fraction of galaxies with morphological signs of interactions is larger at
higher redshift. This is consistent with the nature of local luminous IR
galaxies found by IRAS, which often exhibit evidence of galaxy interaction or
merging and indicates that interactions should play a crucial role in the
evolution of galaxies as expected from bottom-up scenarios.

"  A unified response theory for the time-resolved nonlinear light generation
and two-photon photoemission (2PPE) from metal surfaces is presented. The
theory allows to describe the dependence of the nonlinear optical response and
the photoelectron yield, respectively, on the time dependence of the exciting
light field. Quantum-mechanical interference effects affect the results
significantly. Contributions to 2PPE due to the optical nonlinearity of the
surface region are derived and shown to be relevant close to a plasmon
resonance. The interplay between pulse shape, relaxation times of excited
electrons, and band structure is analyzed directly in the time domain. While
our theory works for arbitrary pulse shapes, we mainly focus on the case of two
pulses of the same mean frequency. Difficulties in extracting relaxation rates
from pump-probe experiments are discussed, for example due to the effect of
detuning of intermediate states on the interference. The theory also allows to
determine the range of validity of the optical Bloch equations and of
semiclassical rate equations, respectively. Finally, we discuss how collective
plasma excitations affect the nonlinear optical response and 2PPE.

"  Many computational problems admit fast algorithms on special inputs, however,
the required properties might be quite restrictive. E.g., many graph problems
can be solved much faster on interval or cographs, or on graphs of small

attain the greatest generality of such results, i.e., being applicable to less
restrictive input classes, without losing much in terms of running time.
  Building on the use of algebraic expressions we present a clean and robust
way of combining such homogeneous structure into more complex heterogeneous

tree-depth, and a natural notion of modular tree-depth. We give a generic
framework for designing efficient parameterized algorithms on the created graph

cases. To show the applicability we give efficient parameterized algorithms for
Negative Cycle Detection, Vertex-Weighted All-Pairs Shortest Paths, and

"  The generalized Einstein Hilbert action is an extension of the classic scalar

convergence is also independent of the transmission condition. In addition,
both of these new algorithms implemented in parallel cluster are robust,

build a colour-magnitude diagram of cluster galaxies. Galaxies in the core of
the cluster form a tight red sequence with a mean J-Ks colour of 1.9 (Vega

"  Several supernovae (SNe) with an unusually dense circumstellar medium (CSM)
have been recently observed at radio frequencies. Their radio emission is
powered by relativistic electrons that can be either accelerated at the SN
shock (primaries) or injected as a by-product (secondaries) of inelastic
proton-proton collisions. We investigate the radio signatures from secondary
electrons, by detailing a semi-analytical model to calculate the temporal
evolution of the distributions of protons, primary and secondary electrons.
With our formalism, we track the cooling history of all the particles that have
been injected into the emission region up to a given time, and calculate the
resulting radio spectra and light curves. For a SN shock propagating through
the progenitor wind, we find that secondary electrons control the early radio
signatures, but their contribution decays faster than that of primary
electrons. This results in a flattening of the light curve at a given radio
frequency that depends only upon the radial profiles of the CSM density and of
the shock velocity, $v_0$. The relevant transition time at the peak frequency
is $\sim 190 \, K_{\rm ep,-3}^{-1} A_{\rm w, 16} \beta_{0, -1.5}^{-2}\,{\rm

explicitly show that late peak times at 5 GHz (i.e., $t_{\rm pk} \gtrsim

"  We study the mathematical theory of second order systems with two species,

the $1$ space dimensional case but allow for initial data taken in a
Wasserstein space of probability measures. We first consider the case of smooth
nonlocal interaction potentials, not subject to any symmetry condition, and
prove existence and uniqueness. The concept of solutions relies on a stickiness
condition in case of collisions, in the spirit of previous works in the
literature. The result uses concepts from classical Hilbert space theory of

large-time and large-damping scaled version of our system and prove convergence
to solutions to the corresponding first order system. Finally, we consider the
case of Newtonian potentials -- subject to symmetry of the cross-interaction

times towards Dirac delta solutions for the two densities. All the results
share a common technical framework in that solutions are considered in a

$L^2$ estimates of the pseudo-inverse variables corresponding to the two

under a rather weak condition on the initial data, which does not require

paths. For $d(n)=n^{o(1)}$ we show that $G(n,d(n)/n)$ has asymptotically almost
surely (a.a.s.~) bounded local treewidth and therefore is a.a.s.~nowhere dense.
We also discover a new and simpler proof that $G(n,d/n)$ has a.a.s.~bounded
expansion for constant~$d$. The local structure of sparse Erdos-Renyi Gaphs is
very special: The $r$-neighborhood of a vertex is a tree with some additional
edges, where the probability that there are $m$ additional edges decreases
with~$m$. This implies efficient algorithms for subgraph isomorphism, in
particular for finding subgraphs with small diameter. Finally we note that
experiments suggest that preferential attachment graphs might have similar
properties after deleting a small number of vertices.

"  Predicting an athlete's performance based on short footage is highly
challenging. Performance prediction requires high domain knowledge and enough
evidence to infer an appropriate quality assessment. Sports pundits can often
infer this kind of information in real-time. In this paper, we propose
regressing an ultra-distance runner cumulative race time (CRT), i.e., the time
the runner has been in action since the race start, by using only a few seconds
of footage as input. We modified the I3D ConvNet backbone slightly and trained
a newly added regressor for that purpose. We use appropriate pre-processing of
the visual input to enable transfer learning from a specific runner. We show
that the resulting neural network can provide a remarkable performance for
short input footage: 18 minutes and a half mean absolute error in estimating
the CRT for runners who have been in action from 8 to 20 hours. Our methodology
has several favorable properties: it does not require a human expert to provide
any insight, it can be used at any moment during the race by just observing a
runner, and it can inform the race staff about a runner at any given time.

"  Memristors as emergent nano-electronic devices have been successfully
fabricated and used in non-conventional and neuromorphic computing systems in
the last years. Several behavioral or physical based models have been developed
to explain their operation and to optimize their fabrication parameters. All
existing memristor models are trade-offs between accuracy, universality and
realism, but, to the best of our knowledge, none of them is purely
characterized as quantum mechanical, despite the fact that quantum mechanical
processes are a major part of the memristor operation. In this paper, we employ
quantum mechanical methods to develop a complete and accurate filamentary model
for the resistance variation during memristor's operating cycle. More
specifically, we apply quantum walks to model and compute the motion of atoms
forming the filament, tight-binding Hamiltonians to capture the filament
structure and the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method to compute the
conductance of the device. Furthermore, we proceeded with the parallelization
of the overall model through Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate
our computations and enhance the model's performance adequately. Our simulation
results successfully reproduce the resistive switching characteristics of
memristors devices, match with existing fabricated devices experimental data,
prove the efficacy and robustness of the proposed model in terms of
multi-parameterization, and provide a new and useful insight into its
operation.

"  Gamma-ray burst remnants become trans-relativistic typically in days to tens
of days, and they enter the deep Newtonian phase in tens of days to months,
during which the majority of shock-accelerated electrons will no longer be
highly relativistic. However, a small portion of electrons are still
accelerated to ultra-relativistic speeds and capable of emitting synchrotron
radiation. The distribution function for electrons is re-derived here so that
synchrotron emission from these relativistic electrons can be calculated. Based
on the revised model, optical afterglows from both isotropic fireballs and
highly collimated jets are studied numerically, and compared to analytical
results. In the beamed cases, it is found that, in addition to the steepening
due to the edge effect and the lateral expansion effect, the light curves are
universally characterized by a flattening during the deep Newtonian phase.

"  Current amount of ~500 asteroid models derived from the disk-integrated
photometry by the lightcurve inversion method allows us to study not only the
spin-vector properties of the whole population of MBAs, but also of several
individual collisional families. We create a data set of 152 asteroids that
were identified by the HCM method as members of ten collisional families, among
them are 31 newly derived unique models and 24 new models with well-constrained
pole-ecliptic latitudes of the spin axes. The remaining models are adopted from
the DAMIT database or the literature. We revise the preliminary family
membership identification by the HCM method according to several additional
criteria - taxonomic type, color, albedo, maximum Yarkovsky semi-major axis
drift and the consistency with the size-frequency distribution of each family,
and consequently we remove interlopers. We then present the spin-vector
distributions for eight asteroidal families. We use a combined orbital- and
spin-evolution model to explain the observed spin-vector properties of objects
among collisional families. In general, we observe for studied families similar
trends in the (a_p, \beta) space: (i) larger asteroids are situated in the
proximity of the center of the family; (ii) asteroids with \beta>0{\deg} are
usually found to the right from the family center; (iii) on the other hand,
asteroids with \beta<0{\deg} to the left from the center; (iv) majority of
asteroids have large pole-ecliptic latitudes (|\beta|\gtrsim 30{\deg}); and
finally (v) some families have a statistically significant excess of asteroids
with \beta>0{\deg} or \beta<0{\deg}. Our numerical simulation of the long-term
evolution of a collisional family is capable of reproducing well the observed
spin-vector properties. Using this simulation, we also independently constrain

consequence, we get an algorithm that finds, for any $\delta>0$, a set of size
$O(s_{\cF}(z^*_\cF))$ that hits $(1-\delta)$-fraction of $\cR$ (with respect to
a given measure) in time proportional to $\log(\frac{1}{\delta})$, where
$s_{\cF}(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ is the size of the smallest $\epsilon$-net the

achieve the same approximation guarantees with running time proportional to

the range space represents the {\it visibility} regions of a polygon in

"  Inversion of potential field data is a central technique of remote sensing in
physics, geophysics, neuroscience and medical imaging. In spite of intense
research, uniqueness theorems for potential-field inversion are scarce. Applied
studies successfully improve potential-field inversion results by including
constraints from independent measurements, but so far no mathematical theorem
guarantees that source localization improves the inversion in terms of
uniqueness of the achieved assignment. Empirical inversion techniques therefore
use numerical and statistical approaches to assess the reliability of their
results. Especially when inverting magnetic field surface measurements, even
seemingly advanced mathematical approaches require substantial additional
assumptions about the source magnetization to achieve a useful reconstruction.
Here, standard potential field theory is used to prove a uniqueness theorem
which completely characterizes the mathematical background of source-localized
inversion. It guarantees for an astonishingly large class of source
localizations that it is possible by potential field measurements on a surface
to differentiate between signals from different source regions. Non-uniqueness
of potential field inversion only prevents that the source distribution within
the individual regions can be uniquely recovered.

"  Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a simple non-invasive measure to identify
heart-related issues such as irregular heartbeats known as arrhythmias. While
artificial intelligence and machine learning is being utilized in a wide range

of the available datasets from which to build and assess machine learning

that future work in arrhythmia classification should follow the AAMI EC57

In the problems, we are given a knapsack with capacity $1$, a buffer with

We consider four variants depending on whether items in the buffer are

"  Radio observations of galaxy clusters show that there are $\mu$G magnetic
fields permeating the intra-cluster medium (ICM), but it is hard to accurately
constrain the strength and structure of the magnetic fields without the help of
advanced computer simulations. We present qualitative comparisons of synthetic
VLA observations of simulated galaxy clusters to radio observations of Faraday
Rotation Measure (RM) and radio halos. The cluster formation is modeled using
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with the
assumption that the initial magnetic fields are injected into the ICM by active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) at high redshift. In addition to simulated clusters in
Xu et al. (2010, 2011), we present a new simulation with magnetic field
injections from multiple AGNs. We find that the cluster with multiple injection
sources is magnetized to a similar level as in previous simulations with a
single AGN. The RM profiles from simulated clusters, both $|RM|$ and the
dispersion of RM ($\sigma_{RM}$), are consistent at a first-order with the
radial distribution from observations. The correlations between the
$\sigma_{RM}$ and X-ray surface brightness from simulations are in a broad
agreement with the observations, although there is an indication that the
simulated clusters could be slightly over-dense and less magnetized with
respect to those in the observed sample. In addition, the simulated radio halos
agree with the observed correlations between the radio power versus the cluster
X-ray luminosity and between the radio power versus the radio halo size. These
studies show that the cluster wide magnetic fields that originate from AGNs and
are then amplified by the ICM turbulence (Xu et al. 2010) match observations of
magnetic fields in galaxy clusters.

"  Traditional searches for radio pulsars have targeted individual small regions
such as supernova remnants or globular clusters, or have covered large
contiguous regions of the sky. None of these searches has been specifically
directed towards giant supershells, some of which are likely to have been
produced by multiple supernova (SN) explosions from an OB association. Here we
perform a Montecarlo simulation of the pulsar population associated with
supershells powered by multiple SNe. We predict that several tens of radio
pulsars could be detected with current instruments associated with the largest
Galactic supershells (with kinetic energies >~ 10^{53} ergs), and a few pulsars
with the smaller ones. We test these predictions for some of the supershells
which lie in regions covered by past pulsar surveys. For the smaller
supershells, our results are consistent with the few detected pulsars per
bubble. For the giant supershell GSH 242-03+37, we find the multiple SN
hypothesis inconsistent with current data at the 95% level. We stress the
importance of undertaking deep pulsar surveys in correlation with supershells.
Failure to detect any pulsar enhancement in the largest of them would put
serious constraints on the multiple SN origin for them. Conversely, the
discovery of the pulsar population associated with a supershell would allow a
different/independent approach to the study of pulsar properties.

"  The problem of data augmentation in feature space is considered. A new
architecture, denoted the FeATure TransfEr Network (FATTEN), is proposed for
the modeling of feature trajectories induced by variations of object pose. This
architecture exploits a parametrization of the pose manifold in terms of pose
and appearance. This leads to a deep encoder/decoder network architecture,
where the encoder factors into an appearance and a pose predictor. Unlike
previous attempts at trajectory transfer, FATTEN can be efficiently trained
end-to-end, with no need to train separate feature transfer functions. This is
realized by supplying the decoder with information about a target pose and the
use of a multi-task loss that penalizes category- and pose-mismatches. In
result, FATTEN discourages discontinuous or non-smooth trajectories that fail
to capture the structure of the pose manifold, and generalizes well on object
recognition tasks involving large pose variation. Experimental results on the
artificial ModelNet database show that it can successfully learn to map source
features to target features of a desired pose, while preserving class identity.
Most notably, by using feature space transfer for data augmentation (w.r.t.
pose and depth) on SUN-RGBD objects, we demonstrate considerable performance
improvements on one/few-shot object recognition in a transfer learning setup,
compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

"  Radiative coolers that can passively cool objects by radiating heat into the

of their performance as well as their ideal spectral design are still unknown.
We present the fundamental lower bound of the temperature of a radiatively
cooled object on earth surfaces under general conditions, including
non-radiative heat transfer, and the upper bound of the net radiative power
density of a radiative cooler as a function of temperature. We derive the ideal
spectral emissivities that can realize such bounds and, contrary to common
belief, find that the ideal emission window is different from 8 to 13 um and
forms disjointed sets of wavelengths, whose width diminishes at lower
temperatures. We show that ideal radiative coolers with perfect thermal
insulation against conduction and convection have a steady-state temperature of
243.6 K in summer and 180.5 K in winter, much below previously measured values.
We also provide the ideal emission window for a single-band emitter and show
that this window should be much narrower than that of previous designs if the
objective is to build a radiative freezer that can operate in summer. We
provide a general guideline for designing spectral emissivity to achieve the
maximum temperature drop or the maximum net radiative power density.

"  Graph embedding is a powerful method to represent graph neurological data
(e.g., brain connectomes) in a low dimensional space for brain connectivity
mapping, prediction and classification. However, existing embedding algorithms
have two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on preserving
one-to-one topological relationships between nodes (i.e., regions of interest
(ROIs) in a connectome), but they have mostly ignored many-to-many
relationships (i.e., set to set), which can be captured using a hyperconnectome
structure. Second, existing graph embedding techniques cannot be easily adapted
to multi-view graph data with heterogeneous distributions. In this paper, while
cross-pollinating adversarial deep learning with hypergraph theory, we aim to
jointly learn deep latent embeddings of subject0specific multi-view brain
graphs to eventually disentangle different brain states. First, we propose a
new simple strategy to build a hyperconnectome for each brain view based on
nearest neighbour algorithm to preserve the connectivities across pairs of
ROIs. Second, we design a hyperconnectome autoencoder (HCAE) framework which
operates directly on the multi-view hyperconnectomes based on hypergraph
convolutional layers to better capture the many-to-many relationships between
brain regions (i.e., nodes). For each subject, we further regularize the
hypergraph autoencoding by adversarial regularization to align the distribution
of the learned hyperconnectome embeddings with that of the input
hyperconnectomes. We formalize our hyperconnectome embedding within a geometric
deep learning framework to optimize for a given subject, thereby designing an
individual-based learning framework. Our experiments showed that the learned
embeddings by HCAE yield to better results for brain state classification

"  We revisit a single-server retrial queue with two independent Poisson streams
(corresponding to two types of customers) and two orbits. The size of each
orbit is infinite. The exponential server (with a rate independent of the type
of customers) can hold at most one customer at a time and there is no waiting
room. Upon arrival, if a type $i$ customer $(i=1,2)$ finds a busy server, it
will join the type $i$ orbit. After an exponential time with a constant
(retrial) rate $\mu_i$, an type $i$ customer attempts to get service. This
model has been recently studied by Avrachenkov, Nain and
Yechiali~\cite{ANY2014} by solving a Riemann-Hilbert boundary value problem.
One may notice that, this model is not a random walk in the quarter plane.
Instead, it can be viewed as a random walk in the quarter plane modulated by a
two-state Markov chain, or a two-dimensional quasi-birth-and-death (QBD)
process. The special structure of this chain allows us to deal with the
fundamental form corresponding to one state of the chain at a time, and
therefore it can be studied through a boundary value problem. Inspired by this
fact, in this paper, we focus on the tail asymptotic behaviour of the
stationary joint probability distribution of the two orbits with either an idle
or busy server by using the kernel method, a different one that does not
require a full determination of the unknown generating function. To take
advantage of existing literature results on the kernel method, we identify a
censored random walk, which is an usual walk in the quarter plane. This
technique can also be used for other random walks modulated by a finite-state
Markov chain with a similar structure property.

"  Context. Synthetic model atmosphere calculations are still the most commonly
used tool when determining precise stellar parameters and stellar chemical
compositions. Besides three-dimensional models that consistently solve for
hydrodynamic processes, one-dimensional models that use an approximation for

  Aims. We use modern Balmer-line formation theory as well as spectral energy
distribution (SED) measurements for the Sun and Procyon to calibrate the model
parameter {\alpha} that describes the efficiency of convection in our 1D
models. Convection was calibrated over a significant range in parameter space,
reaching from F-K along the main sequence and sampling the turnoff and giant
branch over a wide range of metallicities. This calibration was compared to
theoretical evaluations and allowed an accurate modeling of stellar
atmospheres.
  Methods. We used Balmer-line fitting and SED fits to determine the convective
efficiency parameter {\alpha}. Both methods are sensitive to the structure and
temperature stratification of the deeper photosphere.
  Results. While SED fits do not allow a precise determination of the
convective parameter for the Sun and Procyon, they both favor values
significantly higher than 1.0. Balmer-line fitting, which we find to be more
sensitive, suggests that the convective efficiency parameter {\alpha} is
$\approx$ 2.0 for the main sequence and quickly decreases to $\approx$ 1.0 for
evolved stars. These results are highly consistent with predictions from 3D
models. While the values on the main sequence fit predictions very well,
measurements suggest that the decrease of convective efficiency as stars evolve
to the giant branch is more dramatic than predicted by models.

"  Acoustic wave devices provide a promising chip-scale platform for efficiently
coupling radio frequency (RF) and optical fields. Here, we use an integrated
piezo-optomechanical circuit platform that exploits both the piezoelectric and
photoelastic coupling mechanisms to link 2.4 GHz RF waves to 194 THz (1550 nm)
optical waves, through coupling to propagating and localized 2.4 GHz acoustic
waves. We demonstrate acousto-optic modulation, resonant in both the optical
and mechanical domains, in which waveforms encoded on the RF carrier are mapped
to the optical field. We also show opto-acoustic modulation, in which the
application of optical pulses gates the transmission of propagating acoustic
waves. The time-domain characteristics of this system under both pulsed RF and
pulsed optical excitation are considered in the context of the different
physical pathways involved in driving the acoustic waves, and modeled through
the coupled mode equations of cavity optomechanics.

"  In this paper, we examine the problem of visibility-aware robot navigation
among movable obstacles (VANAMO). A variant of the well-known NAMO robotic
planning problem, VANAMO puts additional visibility constraints on robot motion
and object movability. This new problem formulation lifts the restrictive
assumption that the map is fully visible and the object positions are fully
known. We provide a formal definition of the VANAMO problem and propose the
Look and Manipulate Backchaining (LaMB) algorithm for solving such problems.
LaMB has a simple vision-based API that makes it more easily transferable to
real-world robot applications and scales to the large 3D environments. To
evaluate LaMB, we construct a set of tasks that illustrate the complex
interplay between visibility and object movability that can arise in mobile
base manipulation problems in unknown environments. We show that LaMB
outperforms NAMO and visibility-aware motion planning approaches as well as
simple combinations of them on complex manipulation problems with partial
observability.

"  Alpha-Fe2O3 and alpha-Cr2O3 has been mechanical alloyed to prepare Fe1-xCrxO3
oxides for x = 0.2-0.8. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectra have
shown inhomogeneous structure of {\alpha}-Fe2O3 and {\alpha}-Cr2O3 phases in
as-alloyed samples. The as-alloyed samples have shown soft ferromagnetic
properties with signature of two Morin transitions. The heat treatment of
as-alloyed samples has homogenized structure and successfully incorporated the
Cr atoms into the lattice sites of Fe atoms in {\alpha}-Fe2O3. The magnetic and
electrical properties have been modified in the heat treated samples. For
example, canted antiferromagnetic order has been appeared as an effect of heat
treatment, irrespective of the Cr content in Fe1-xCrxO3. The magnetic field
induced spin flop transition has been observed at a critical magnetic field
that depends on Cr content in the system. The M\""ossbauer spectrum at room
temperature has been fitted with two sextets. The variation of M\""ossbauer
parameters suggest a distribution of magnetic spin order between Fe and Cr ions
in the rhombohedral structure of Fe1-xCrxO3. The electrical conductivity,
derived from current-voltage characteristics of the heat treated samples, has
been enhanced by increasing Cr content in alpha-Fe2O3 structure. The

"  (shortened) We investigate the properties of Galactic WR stars and their
environment to identify evolutionary channels that may lead to the formation of
LGRBs. To this purpose we compile available information on the
spectropolarimetric properties, the presence of CS ejecta, and the CS
velocities in the environment of Galactic WR stars. We use linear
line-depolarization as an indicator of rotation, nebular morphology as an
indicator of stellar ejecta, and velocity patterns in UV absorption features as
an indicator of increased velocities in the CS environment. We find that the
~23% WR stars with ""possible ejecta nebulae"" dominate the population of WR
stars with spectropolarimetric signatures of rotation, while WR stars without
such nebulae only rarely show indications of rotation. The corresponding
objects are most likely in an early stage after a preceding RSG or LBV phase,
and have not yet lost their angular momenta due to the strong mass-loss in the
WR phase. From their photometric periods we estimate rotation parameters in the
range omega = 0.04...0.25, corresponding to moderate rotation speeds of
36...120 km/s. These values are very uncertain, but comply with the specific
surface angular momentum requirement for LGRB progenitors. Our results indicate
that, in the Galaxy, mainly ""young"" WR stars shortly after a RSG/LBV phase show
spectropolarimetric signatures of rotation. Their rotation rates are thus
likely enhanced with respect to the majority of Galactic WR stars. According to
their estimated specific surface angular momenta, a subgroup of stars exploding
in this phase may represent an evolutionary channel towards LGRBs at high
metallicities, comparable to the Galaxy.

"  In the presence of the Josephson vortex lattice in layered superconductors, a
small c-axis magnetic field penetrates in the form of vortex chains. In
general, the structure of a single chain is determined by the ratio of the
London [$\lambda$] and Josephson [$\lambda_{J}$] lengths, $\alpha=
\lambda/\lambda_{J}$. The chain is composed of tilted vortices at large
$\alpha$'s (tilted chain) and at small $\alpha$'s it consists of a crossing
array of Josephson vortices and pancake-vortex stacks (crossing chain). We
study chain structures at intermediate $\alpha$'s and found two types of phase
transitions. For $\alpha\lesssim 0.6$ the ground state is given by the crossing
chain in a wide range of pancake separations $a\gtrsim [2-3]\lambda_J$.
However, due to attractive coupling between deformed pancake stacks, the
equilibrium separation can not exceed some maximum value depending on the
in-plane field and $\alpha$. The first phase transition takes place with
decreasing pancake-stack separation $a$ at $a=[1-2]\lambda_{J}$, and rather
wide range of the ratio $\alpha$, $0.4 \lesssim \alpha\lesssim 0.65$. With
decreasing $a$, the crossing chain goes through intermediate strongly-deformed
configurations and smoothly transforms into a tilted chain via a second-order
phase transition. Another phase transition occurs at very small densities of
pancake vortices, $a\sim [20-30]\lambda_J$, and only when $\alpha$ exceeds a
certain critical value $\sim 0.5$. In this case a small c-axis field penetrates
in the form of kinks. However, at very small concentration of kinks, the kinked
chains are replaced with strongly deformed crossing chains via a first-order
phase transition. This transition is accompanied by a very large jump in the
pancake density.

"  Using demographic data of high spatial resolution for a region in the south
of Europe, we study the population over fixed-size spatial cells. We find that,
counterintuitively, the distribution of the number of inhabitants per cell
increases its variability when the size of the cells is increased.
Nevertheless, the shape of the distributions is kept constant, which allows us
to introduce a scaling law, analogous to finite-size scaling, with a scaling
function reasonably well fitted by a gamma distribution. This means that the
distribution of the number of inhabitants per cell is stable or invariant under
addition with neighboring cells (plus rescaling), defying the central-limit
theorem, due to the obvious dependence of the random variables. The finite-size
scaling implies a power-law relations between the moments of the distribution
and its scale parameter, which are found to be related with the fractal
properties of the spatial pattern formed by the population. The match between
theoretical predictions and empirical results is reasonably good.

Fine guidance using image similarity. The latter guidance helps avoid overly

symmetric and regular boundaries of airplanes from the top view. Then, the
generated proposals are used to train a deep convolutional neural network for
removing non-airplane proposals. Since each airplane can have multiple SLS
proposals, where some of them are not in the direction of the fuselage, we
collect all proposals corresponding to one ground-truth as a positive bag and
the others as the negative instances. To have multiple instance deep learning,
we modify the loss function of the network to learn from each positive bag at

"  The dynamics of saturated vapor between two intersecting walls is examined.
It is shown that, if the angle $\phi$ between the walls is sufficiently small,
the vapor becomes unstable, and spontaneous condensation occurs in the corner,
similar to the so-called capillary condensation of vapor into a porous medium.
As a result, an ever-growing liquid meniscus develops near the corner. The
diffuse-interface model and the lubrication approximation are used to
demonstrate that the meniscus grows if and only if $\phi+2\theta<\pi$, where
$\theta$ is the contact angle corresponding to the fluid/solid combination
under consideration. This criterion has a simple physical explanation: if it
holds, the meniscus surface is concave -- hence, the Kelvin effect causes
condensation. Once the thickness of the condensate exceeds by an order of
magnitude the characteristic interfacial thickness, the volume of the meniscus
starts to grow linearly with time. If the near-vertex region of the corner is
smoothed, the instability can be triggered off only by finite-size
perturbations, such that include enough liquid to cover the smoothed aria by a
microscopically-thin liquid film.

in general only be attained by discontinuous, hence not physical, velocities.
However, we prove that these generalized eigenfunctions, whose jumps we refer
to as limiting yield surfaces, appear as rescaled limits of the physical

Furthermore, a numerical method for the minimization is then considered. It is
based on a nonlinear finite difference discretization, whose consistency is

The BALDA calculated values for the static linear polarizability are compared

Finally we provide a numerical proof for the non-locality of the exact exchange

"  A major open problem in the area of infinite-duration games is to
characterize winning conditions that are determined in finite-memory
strategies. Infinite-duration games are usually studied over edge-colored
graphs, with winning conditions that are defined in terms of sequences of
colors. In this paper, we investigate a restricted class of finite-memory
strategies called chromatic finite-memory strategies. While general
finite-memory strategies operate with sequences of edges of a game graph,
chromatic finite-memory strategies observe only colors of these edges.
  Recent results in this area show that studying finite-memory determinacy is
more tractable when we restrict ourselves to chromatic strategies. On the other
hand, as was shown by Le Roux (CiE 2020), determinacy in general finite-memory
strategies implies determinacy in chromatic finite-memory strategies.
Unfortunately, this result is quite inefficient in terms of the state
complexity: to replace a winning strategy with few states of general memory, we
might need much more states of chromatic memory. The goal of the present paper
is to find out the exact state complexity of this transformation.
  For every winning condition and for every game graph with $n$ nodes we show
the following: if this game graph has a winning strategy with $q$ states of
general memory, then it also has a winning strategy with $(q + 1)^n$ states of
chromatic memory. We also show that this bound is almost tight. For every $q$
and $n$, we construct a winning condition and a game graph with $n + O(1)$
nodes, where one can win with $q$ states of general memory, but not with $q^n -
1$ states of chromatic memory.

"  The Arrhenius crossover temperature, $T_{A}$, corresponds to a thermodynamic
state wherein the atomistic dynamics of a liquid becomes heterogeneous and
cooperative; and the activation barrier of diffusion dynamics becomes
temperature-dependent at temperatures below $T_{A}$. The theoretical estimation
of this temperature is difficult for some types of materials, especially
silicates and borates. In these materials, self-diffusion as a function of the
temperature $T$ is reproduced by the Arrhenius law, where the activation
barrier practically independent on the temperature $T$. The purpose of the
present work was to establish the relationship between the Arrhenius crossover
temperature $T_{A}$ and the physical properties of liquids directly related to
their glass-forming ability. Using a machine learning model, the crossover
temperature $T_{A}$ was calculated for silicates, borates, organic compounds
and metal melts of various compositions. The empirical values of the glass
transition temperature $T_{g}$, the melting temperature $T_{m}$, the ratio of
these temperatures $T_{g}/T_{m}$ and the fragility index $m$ were applied as
input parameters. It has been established that the temperatures $T_{g}$ and
$T_{m}$ are significant parameters, whereas their ratio $T_{g}/T_{m}$ and the
fragility index $m$ do not correlate much with the temperature $T_{A}$. An
important result of the present work is the analytical equation relating the
temperatures $T_{g}$, $T_{m}$ and $T_{A}$, and that, from the algebraic point
of view, is the equation for a second-order curved surface. It was shown that
this equation allows one to correctly estimate the temperature $T_{A}$ for a
large class of materials, regardless of their compositions and glass-forming
abilities.

"  The set of the graphs which do not contain the complete graph on $q$ vertices
$K_q$ and have the property that in every coloring of their edges in two colors
there exist a monochromatic triangle is denoted by $\mathcal{H}_e(3, 3; q)$.
The edge Folkman numbers $F_e(3, 3; q) = \min\{|V(G)| : G \in \mathcal{H}_e(3,
3; q)\}$ are considered. Folkman proved in 1970 that $F_e(3, 3; q)$ exists if
and only if $q \geq 4$. From the Ramsey number $R(3, 3) = 6$ it becomes clear
that $F_e(3, 3; q) = 6$ if $q \geq 7$. It is also known that $F_e(3, 3; 6) = 8$
and $F_e(3, 3; 5) = 15$. The upper bounds on the number $F_e(3, 3; 4)$ which
follow from the construction of Folkman and from the constructions of some
other authors are not good. In 1975 Erdo\""s posed the problem to prove the
inequality $F_e(3, 3; 4) < 10^{10}$. This Erdo\""s problem was solved by Spencer
in 1978. The last upper bound on $F_e(3, 3; 4)$ was obtained in 2012 by Lange,
Radziszowski and Xu, who proved that $F_e(3, 3; 4) \leq 786$. The best lower
bound on this number is 19 and was obtained 10 years ago by Radziszowski and
Xu. In this paper, we improve this result by proving $F_e(3, 3; 4) \geq 20$. At
the end of the paper, we improve the known bounds on the vertex Folkman number
$F_v(2, 3, 3; 4)$ by proving $20 \leq F_v(2, 3, 3; 4) \leq 24$.

"  When the accretion disc around a weakly magnetised neutron star (NS) meets
the stellar surface, it should brake down to match the rotation of the NS,
forming a boundary layer. As the mechanisms potentially responsible for this
braking are apparently inefficient, it is reasonable to consider this layer as
a spreading layer (SL) with negligible radial extent and structure. We perform
hydrodynamical 2D spectral simulations of an SL, considering the disc as a
source of matter and angular momentum. Interaction of new, rapidly rotating
matter with the pre-existing, relatively slow material co-rotating with the
star leads to instabilities capable of transferring angular momentum and
creating variability on dynamical timescales. For small accretion rates, we
find that the SL is unstable for heating instability that disrupts the initial
latitudinal symmetry and produces large deviations between the two hemispheres.
This instability also results in breaking of the axial symmetry as coherent
flow structures are formed and escape from the SL intermittently. At enhanced
accretion rates, the SL is prone to shearing instability and acts as a source
of oblique waves that propagate towards the poles, leading to patterns that
again break the axial symmetry. We compute artificial light curves of an SL
viewed at different inclination angles. Most of the simulated light curves show
oscillations at frequencies close to 1kHz. We interpret these oscillations as
inertial modes excited by shear instabilities near the boundary of the SL.
Their frequencies, dependence on flux, and amplitude variations can explain the
high-frequency pair quasi-periodic oscillations observed in many low-mass X-ray
binaries.

"  We discuss the occurrence of crossing points in the magnetization -
temperature $(m,T$) plane within the framework of critical phenomena. It is
shown that in a two-dimensional superconducting slab of thickness $d_{s}$
$m_{z}(\delta)$ versus temperature $T$ curves measured in different fields
$\mathbf{H} = H(0,\sin (\delta) ,\cos (\delta))$ will cross at the critical
temperature T_c of the slab. In contrast, in a 3D anisotropic bulk
superconductor the crossing point occurs in the plot $m_{z}(\delta)
/H_{z}^{1/2}$ versus $T$. The experimental facts that 2D crossing point
features have been observed in ceramics and in single crystals for $\mathbf{H}$
close to $\mathbf{H} = H(0,0,1)$, but not for $\mathbf{H} = H(0,1,0)$, is
explained in terms of an angle-dependent crossover field separating the regions
where 2D or 3D thermal fluctuations dominate. The measured 2D-crossing point
data are used to estimate one of the fundamental parameters of cuprate
superconductors, the minimum thickness of the slab $(d_{s})$, which remains
superconducting. Our estimates, based on experimental 2D-crossing point data
for single crystals, reveal that this length adopts material dependent values.
Therefore, experimental data for T_c and $\lambda_{\Vert}^{2}(T=0)$, plotted in
terms of T_c versus $1/\lambda_{\Vert}^{2}(T=0)$ will not tend to a straight
line with universal slope as the underdoped limit is approached. Implications
for magnetic torque measurements are also worked out.

SOL2014-03-29T17:48, obtained with the Facility Infrared Spectrometer (FIRS) at
the Dunn Solar Telescope. While scanning active region NOAA 12017, the FIRS
slit crossed a flare ribbon during the impulsive phase, when the helium line
intensities turned into emission at $<$ twice the continuum intensity. Their
linear polarization profiles are of the same sign across the multiplet
including 1082.9 nm, intensity-like, at $<5$\% of the continuum intensity.
Weaker Zeeman-induced linear polarization is also observed. Only the strongest
linear polarization coincides with hard X-ray (HXR) emission at 30-70 keV
observed by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscope Imager. The
polarization is generally more extended and lasts longer than the HXR emission.
The upper $J=0$ level of the 1082.9~nm component is unpolarizable, thus lower
level polarization is the culprit. We make non-LTE radiative transfer
calculations in thermal slabs optimized to fit only intensities. The linear
polarizations are naturally reproduced, through a systematic change of sign
with wavelength of the radiation anisotropy when slab optical depths of the
1082.9 component are $< 1$. Collisions with beams of particles are neither
needed nor can they produce the same sign of polarization of the 1082.9 and
1083.0 nm components. The He I line polarization merely requires heating
sufficient to produce slabs of the required thickness. Widely different
polarizations of H$\alpha$, reported previously, are explained by different
radiative anisotropies arising from slabs of different optical depths.

"  This paper proposes a generalised framework for density estimation in large
networks with measurable spatiotemporal variance in edge weights. We solve the
stochastic shortest path problem for a large network by estimating the density
of the edge weights in the network and analytically finding the distribution of
a path. In this study, we employ Gaussian Processes to model the edge weights.
This approach not only reduces the analytical complexity associated with
computing the stochastic shortest path but also yields satisfactory
performance. We also provide an online version of the model that yields a 30
times speedup in the algorithm's runtime while retaining equivalent
performance. As an application of the model, we design a real-time trip
planning system to find the stochastic shortest path between locations in the
public transit network of Delhi. Our observations show that different paths
have different likelihoods of being the shortest path at any given time in a
public transit network. We demonstrate that choosing the stochastic shortest
path over a deterministic shortest path leads to savings in travel time of up
to 40\%. Thus, our model takes a significant step towards creating a reliable
trip planner and increase the confidence of the general public in developing
countries to take up public transit as a primary mode of transportation.

"  The unit disk graph (UDG) is a widely employed model for the study of
wireless networks. In this model, wireless nodes are represented by points in
the plane and there is an edge between two points if and only if their
Euclidean distance is at most one. A hop spanner for the UDG is a spanning
subgraph $H$ such that for every edge $(p,q)$ in the UDG the topological
shortest path between $p$ and $q$ in $H$ has a constant number of edges. The
hop stretch factor of $H$ is the maximum number of edges of these paths. A hop
spanner is plane (i.e. embedded planar) if its edges do not cross each other.
  The problem of constructing hop spanners for the UDG has received
considerable attention in both computational geometry and wireless ad hoc
networks. Despite this attention, there has not been significant progress on
getting hop spanners that (i) are plane, and (ii) have low hop stretch factor.
Previous constructions either do not ensure the planarity or have high hop
stretch factor. The only construction that satisfies both conditions is due to
Catusse, Chepoi, and Vax\`{e}s (2010); their plane hop spanner has hop stretch
factor at most 449.
  Our main result is a simple algorithm that constructs a plane hop spanner for
the UDG. In addition to the simplicity, the hop stretch factor of the
constructed spanner is at most 341. Even though the algorithm itself is simple,
its analysis is rather involved. Several results on the plane geometry are
established in the course of the proof. These results are of independent
interest.

emission is centred on the optical/radio nucleus, but is spatially extended.
The X-ray spectrum can be well fitted by a thermal plasma model, with
kT=0.6-0.8keV and a low local absorbing column. The thermal spectrum is
suggestive of starburst emission rather than emission from a central
black-hole.

"  In a dynamic nuclear polarization experiment on a 40 mM solution of
4-amino-TEMPO in a 40:60 water/glycerol mixture, we have observed that the bulk
dipolar reservoir is cooled to a spin temperature of 15.5 micro-K, following
microwave irradiation for 800 s. This is significantly cooler than the 35 mK
spin temperature of the Zeeman reservoir. Equilibration of the two reservoirs
results in a 50 % increase in the NMR signal intensity, corresponding to a
Zeeman spin temperature of 23 mK. In order to achieve this polarization
directly, it was necessary to irradiate the sample with microwaves for 1500 s.
Cooling of the dipolar reservoir occurs during polarization transport through
the magnetic field gradient around the paramagnetic impurity, and is rapidly
communicated to the bulk by dipolar spin diffusion. As dipolar spin diffusion
is significantly faster than Zeeman spin diffusion, the bulk dipolar reservoir
cools faster than the Zeeman reservoir. This process can be exploited to
rapidly polarize the nuclear spins, by repeatedly cooling the dipolar system
and transferring the polarization to the Zeeman reservoir.

"  Most studies of mass transfer in binary systems assume circular orbits at the
onset of Roche lobe overflow. However, there are theoretical and observational
indications that mass transfer could occur in eccentric orbits. In particular,
eccentricity could be produced via sudden mass loss and velocity kicks during
supernova explosions, or Lidov-Kozai (LK) oscillations in hierarchical triple
systems, or, more generally, secular evolution in multiple-star systems.
However, current analytic models of eccentric mass transfer are faced with the
problem that they are only well defined in the limit of very high
eccentricities, and break down for less eccentric and circular orbits. This
provides a major obstacle to implementing such models in binary and
higher-order population synthesis codes, which are useful tools for studying
the long-term evolution of a large number of systems. Here, we present a new
analytic model to describe the secular orbital evolution of binaries undergoing
conservative mass transfer. The main improvement of our model is that the mass
transfer rate is a smoothly varying function of orbital phase, rather than a
delta function centered at periapsis. Consequently, our model is in principle
valid for any eccentricity, thereby overcoming the main limitation of previous
works. We implement our model in an easy-to-use and publicly available code
that can be used as a basis for implementations of our model into population
synthesis codes. We investigate the implications of our model in a number of
applications with circular and eccentric binaries, and triples undergoing LK

(ii) to identify the role of the bi-dimensional instability in

elastic scales in the mechanism of self-sustained EIT. Direct numerical
simulations of FENE-P fluid flows are performed in two- and three-dimensional
channels. The Reynolds number is set to $\mathrm{Re}_\tau = 85$ which is
sub-critical for 2D flows but beyond transition for 3D ones. The polymer
properties correspond to those of typical dilute polymer solutions and two
moderate Weissenberg numbers, $\mathrm{Wi}_\tau = 40, 100$, are considered. The
simulation results show that sustained turbulence can be observed in 2D
sub-critical flows, confirming the existence of a bi-dimensional
elasto-inertial instability. The same type of instability is also observed in
3D simulations where both Newtonian and elasto-inertial turbulent structures
co-exist. Depending on the Wi number, one type of structure can dominate and
drive the flow. For large Wi values, the elasto-inertial instability tends to
prevail over the Newtonian turbulence. This statement is supported by (i) the
absence of the typical Newtonian near-wall vortices and (ii) strong
similarities between two- and three-dimensional flows when considering larger
Wi numbers. The role of the small elastic scales is investigated by introducing
global artificial diffusion in the hyperbolic transport equation for polymers.
The study results show that the introduction of large polymer diffusion in the
system strongly damps a significant part of the elastic scales that are
necessary to feed turbulence, eventually leading to the flow laminarization. A
sufficiently high Schmidt number is necessary to allow self-sustained
turbulence to settle.

provides APIs for software developers. Our experimental results demonstrate
that ARAPrototyper enables a wide range of design space explorations for ARAs

Citation-based data usually need too long to accrue. In this study, we proposed
a method based on bibliometric data for the identification of young talented

older cohort with their first publication between 1999 and 2003 was used to
find the most suitable indicator combination. For the validation step, citation

young talented individuals who published their first paper within this time

"  Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting with large language models has proven
effective in numerous natural language processing tasks, but designing prompts
that generalize well to diverse problem types can be challenging, especially in
the context of math word problem (MWP) solving. Additionally, it is common to
have a large amount of training data that have a better diversity coverage but
CoT annotations are not available, which limits the use of supervised learning
techniques. To address these issues, we investigate two approaches to leverage
the training data in a few-shot prompting scenario: dynamic program prompting
and program distillation. Our approach is largely inspired by Gao et al.,
(2022), where they proposed to replace the CoT with the programs as the
intermediate reasoning step. Such a prompting strategy allows us to accurately
verify the answer correctness through program execution in MWP solving. Our
dynamic program prompting involves annotating the training data by sampling
correct programs from a large language model, while program distillation
involves adapting a smaller model to the program-annotated training data. Our
experiments on three standard MWP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
these approaches, yielding significant improvements over previous baselines for
prompting and fine-tuning. Our results suggest that leveraging a large amount
of training data can improve the generalization ability of prompts and boost
the performance of fine-tuned small models in MWP solving.

"  The damping ($\Gamma_a$) of the transverse acoustic (TA) phonon in single
crystals of the relaxor $KTa_{1-x}Nb_xO_3$ with x=0.15-0.17 was studied by
means of high resolution inelastic cold neutron scattering near the (200) B.Z.
point where diffuse scattering is absent, although it is present near (110). In
a wide range of temperatures centered on the phase transition, T=195K-108K, the
TA phonon width (damping) exhibits a step increase around momentum q=0.07, goes
through a shallow maximum at q=0.09-0.12 and remains high up to the highest
momentum studied of q=0.16. These experimental results are explained in terms
of a resonant interaction between the TA phonon and the collective or
correlated reorientation through tunneling of the off-center Nb+5 ions. The
observed TA damping is successfully reproduced in a simple model that includes
an interaction between the TA phonon and a dispersionless localized mode (LM)
with frequency $\omega_L$ and damping $\Gamma_L$ ($\Gamma_L < \omega_L$),
itself coupled to the transverse optic (TO) mode. Maximum damping of the TA
phonon occurs when its frequency $\omega_a \approx{\omega_L}$. $\omega_L$ and
$\Gamma_L$ are moderately dependent on temperature but the oscillator strength,
$M_2$, of the resonant damping exhibits a strong maximum in the range
$T\sim{150 K-120 K}$ in which neutron diffuse scattering near the (110) B.Z.
point is also maximum and the dielectric susceptibility exhibits the relaxor
behavior. The maximum value of M appears to be due to the increasing number of
polar nanodomains. In support of the proposed model, the observed value of
$\omega_L$ is found to be similar to the estimate previously obtained by
Girshberg and Yacoby. Alternatively, the TA phonon damping can be successfully
fitted in the framework of an empirical Havriliak - Negami (HN) relaxation
model that includes a strong resonance-like transient contribution.

"  We present two NuSTAR observations of the local Seyfert 2 active galactic
nucleus (AGN) and an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) candidate in NGC 5643.
Together with archival data from Chandra, XMM-Newton and Swift-BAT, we perform
a high-quality broadband spectral analysis of the AGN over two decades in
energy ($\sim$0.5-100 keV). Previous X-ray observations suggested that the AGN
is obscured by a Compton-thick (CT) column of obscuring gas along our
line-of-sight. However, the lack of high-quality $\gtrsim$ 10 keV observations,
together with the presence of a nearby X-ray luminous source, NGC 5643 X-1, had
left significant uncertainties in the characterization of the nuclear spectrum.
NuSTAR now enables the AGN and NGC 5643 X-1 to be separately resolved above 10
keV for the first time and allows a direct measurement of the absorbing column
density toward the nucleus. The new data show that the nucleus is indeed
obscured by a CT column of $N_{\rm{H}}$ $\gtrsim$ 5 $\times$ 10$^{24}$
cm$^{-2}$. The range of 2-10 keV absorption-corrected luminosity inferred from
the best fitting models is $L_{2-10,\rm{int}} =$ (0.8-1.7) $\times$ 10$^{42}$
erg s$^{-1}$, consistent with that predicted from multiwavelength intrinsic
luminosity indicators. We also study the NuSTAR data for NGC 5643 X-1, and show
that it exhibits evidence for a spectral cut-off at energy, $E$ $\sim$ 10 keV,
similar to that seen in other ULXs observed by NuSTAR. Along with the evidence
for significant X-ray luminosity variations in the 3-8 keV band from 2003-2014,
our results further strengthen the ULX classification of NGC 5643 X-1.

"  A mechanism leading to the formation of bound states in the continuum (BICs)
in a planar grating waveguide is revealed. BICs appear when dispersion curves
of the leaking even-parity and non-leaking odd-parity infinite-grating

the leaking eigenmode, causing it to decouple from a spatial Fourier harmonic
that is emitted out of the waveguide. As a result, the otherwise low-Q
waveguide eigenmode, comprised of those two aforementioned and some other
infinite-grating eigenmodes, acquires a very high quality factor in a narrow
vicinity of the mode-crossing frequency. Implementation of such a mechanism can
be instructive for designing BICs in other photonic crystals and structures.

"  We investigate the relationship between the continuum enhancement and the
hard X-ray (HXR) emission of a white-light flare on 2002 September 29. By
reconstructing the RHESSI HXR images in the impulsive phase, we find two bright
conjugate footpoints (FPs) on the two sides of the magnetic neutral line. Using
the thick-target model and assuming a low-energy cutoff of 20 keV, the energy
fluxes of non-thermal electron beams bombarding FPs A and B are estimated to be
1.0 10^10 and 0.8 10^10 ergs/cm^2/s, respectively. However, the continuum
enhancement at the two FPs is not simply proportional to the electron beam
flux. The continuum emission at FP B is relatively strong with a maximum
enhancement of about 8% and correlates temporally well with the HXR profile;
however, that at FP A is less significant with an enhancement of only about
4-5%, regardless of the relatively strong beam flux. By carefully inspecting
the Halpha line profiles, we ascribe such a contrast to different atmospheric
conditions at the two FPs. The Halpha line profile at FP B exhibits a
relatively weak amplitude with a pronounced central reversal, while the profile
at FP A is fairly strong without a visible central reversal. This indicates
that in the early impulsive phase of the flare, the local atmosphere at FP A
has been appreciably heated and the coronal pressure is high enough to prevent
most high-energy electrons from penetrating into the deeper atmosphere; while
at FP B, the atmosphere has not been fully heated, the electron beam can
effectively heat the chromosphere and produce the observed continuum
enhancement via the radiative backwarming effect.

"  Electron-phonon interaction (EPI) is presumably detrimental for
thermoelectric performance in semiconductors because it limits carrier
mobility. Here we show that enhanced EPI with strong energy dependence offers
an intrinsic pathway to significant increase in the Seebeck coefficient and the

energy filtering through preferential scattering of electron/hole carriers. We
prove this concept by implementing state-of-the-art first-principles
computational methods with explicit treatment of EPI for a 2D gapless MoS$_{2}$
allotrope, which has both massless Dirac bands and a heavy-fermion state that
acts as the filter. We determine that the optimal location of the heavy state

opens a new avenue for attaining ultrahigh power factors via engineering the
EPI in graphene-like semimetals or identifying new compounds that intrinsically

cluster members. Additionally, we investigate the effect of an inclination

our results to observational data. We find that galaxies that entered a cluster

cluster centre, tidal interactions are a more efficient mechanism for producing
harassed galaxies. But the inclination of the disk can reduce the mass loss
significantly, yet it amplifies the thickening.

"  We investigate the interplay between large-scale patterns, so-called
superstructures, in the fluctuation fields of temperature $\theta$ and vertical
velocity $w$ in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection at large aspect
ratios. Earlier studies suggested that velocity superstructures were smaller
than their thermal counterparts in the center of the domain. However, a
scale-by-scale analysis of the correlation between the two fields employing the
linear coherence spectrum reveals that superstructures of the same size exist
in both fields, which are almost perfectly correlated. The issue is further
clarified by the observation that in contrast to the temperature, and unlike
assumed previously, superstructures in the vertical velocity field do not
result in a peak in the power spectrum of $w$. The origin of this difference is
traced back to the production terms of the $\theta$- and $w$-variance. These
results are confirmed for a range of Rayleigh numbers $Ra = 10^5$--$10^9$, the
superstructure size is seen to increase monotonically with $Ra$. Furthermore,
the scale distribution of particularly the temperature fluctuations is
pronouncedly bimodal. In addition to the large-scale peak caused by the
superstructures, there exists a strong small-scale peak. This `inner peak' is
most intense at a distance of $\delta_\theta$ from the wall and associated with
structures of size $\approx 10 \delta_\theta$, where $\delta_\theta$ is the
thermal boundary layer thickness. Finally, based on the vertical coherence
relative to a reference height of $\delta_\theta$, a self-similar structure is
identified in the velocity field (vertical and horizontal components) but not
in the temperature.

"  Here we present a model to study the micro-plastic regime of a stress-strain
curve. In this model an explicit dislocation population represents the mobile

constrained to a simple dipolar mat geometry and modelled via a dislocation
dynamics algorithm, whilst the shear-stress field is chosen to be a sinusoidal
function of distance along the mat direction. The latter, defined by a periodic
length and a shear-stress amplitude, represents a pre-existing micro-structure.
These model parameters, along with the mobile dislocation density, are found to
admit a diversity of micro-plastic behaviour involving intermittent plasticity
in the form of a scale-free avalanche phenomenon, with an exponent for the

more complex dislocation dynamics simulations.

Brownian dynamics computer simulations, we investigate how this equilibrium

increases with the speed of self-propulsion (activity) and for higher activity
the cluster size decreases, showing a non-monotonic variation of cluster size
with activity. This clustering behaviour is distinct from the pure kinetic (or
motility-induced) clustering of self-propelling particles which is observed at
significantly higher activities and densities. We present an equilibrium model
incorporating the effect of activity as activity-induced attraction and

It went into operation for the 2007 microlensing observing season. As part of
our discussion about an optimal strategy for planet detection, we shed some new
light on whether concentrating on highly-magnified events is promising and
planets in the 'resonant' angular separation equal to the angular Einstein

considered being common around the host stars probed by microlensing
(preferentially M- and K-dwarfs), the higher number of events that can be
monitored with a network of 2m telescopes and the increased detection
efficiency for planets below 5 M_earth arising from an optimized strategy gives
a common effort of current microlensing campaigns a fair chance to detect an
Earth-mass planet (from the ground) ahead of the COROT or Kepler missions. The
detection limit of gravitational microlensing extends even below 0.1 M_earth,
but such planets are not very likely to be detected from current campaigns.
However, these will be within the reach of high-cadence monitoring with a

of the propagated contours are frequently needed. The edited contours are able
to meet the clinical requirement for adaptive therapy; however, the DVF is
still inaccurate and inconsistent with the edited contours. The purpose of this
work is to develop a contour-guided deformable image registration (CG-DIR)
algorithm to improve the accuracy and consistency of the DVF for adaptive
radiotherapy. Incorporation of the edited contours into the registration
algorithm is realized by regularizing the objective function of the original
demons algorithm with a term of intensity matching between the delineated
structures set pairs. The CG-DIR algorithm is implemented on computer graphics
processing units (GPUs) by following the original GPU-based demons algorithm
computation framework [Gu et al, Phys Med Biol. 55(1): 207-219, 2010]. The
performance of CG-DIR is evaluated on five clinical head-and-neck and one
pelvic cancer patient data. It is found that compared with the original demons,
CG-DIR improves the accuracy and consistency of the DVF, while retaining
similar high computational efficiency.

of the cosmic microwave background, by taking into account the basis rotation

spectrum get enhanced and dominates over the scalar contribution for low
multipoles in a universe with or without recombination. Furthermore, we show
that all full-sky averaged two-point cross-correlation functions of the Stokes

"  In this work we consider the eruption of a tenuous relativistic hydrodynamic
jet from a dense baryonic envelope. As the jet moves out and away, it carries
along and continues to accelerate a layer of baryonic material which we refer
to as the plug. We solve the relativistic equations of motion for the
trajectory of the plug, and verify it using a relativistic hydrodynamic
simulation. We show that under these conditions, the plug breaks up at a radius
larger by a factor of a few from the radius of the envelope, due to the onset
of the Rayleigh Taylor instability. After breakup the jet continues to
accelerate to higher Lorentz factors while the plug fragments maintain a
moderate Lorentz factor. The presence of slower moving ejecta can explain late
time features of GRBs such as X ray flares without recourse to a long lived

adatom on Ag(100) possesses two discrete states with significantly different
apparent heights. These atomic switches also exhibit a Kondo-like feature in
spectroscopy experiments. By extensive theoretical simulations we find that
this behavior is due to diffusion of hydrogen from the surface onto the Ce
adatom in the presence of the STM tip field. The cerium adatom possesses
vibrational modes of very low energy (3-4meV) and very high efficiency (> 20%),
which are due to the large changes of Ce-states in the presence of hydrogen.
The atomic vibrations lead to a Kondo-like feature at very low bias voltages.
We predict that the same low-frequency/high-efficiency modes can also be
observed at lanthanum adatoms.

REAL-SPACE velocity field. Such a comparison possesses all of the advantages of
the conventional redshift-space analyses, while at the same time it is free of

density field in real space is unnecessary, and so is the reconstruction of the
velocity field in redshift space. The redshift-space velocity field can be
reconstructed only at the linear order, because only at this order it is
irrotational. Unlike the conventional redshift-space density--velocity
comparisons, the comparison proposed here does not have to be restricted to the
linear regime. Nonlinear effects can then be used to break the Omega-bias
degeneracy plaguing the analyses based on the linear theory. I present a

an equilibrium between spin-up by accretion and spin-down by the

"  Software contracts allow programmers to state rich program properties using
the full expressive power of an object language. However, since they are
enforced at runtime, monitoring contracts imposes significant overhead and
delays error discovery. So contract verification aims to guarantee all or most
of these properties ahead of time, enabling valuable optimizations and yielding
a more general assurance of correctness. Existing methods for static contract
verification satisfy the needs of more restricted target languages, but fail to
address the challenges unique to those conjoining untyped, dynamic programming,
higher-order functions, modularity, and statefulness. Our approach tackles all
these features at once, in the context of the full Racket system---a mature
environment for stateful, higher-order, multi-paradigm programming with or
without types. Evaluating our method using a set of both pure and stateful
benchmarks, we are able to verify 99.94% of checks statically (all but 28 of
49, 861).
  Stateful, higher-order functions pose significant challenges for static
contract verification in particular. In the presence of these features, a
modular analysis must permit code from the current module to escape permanently
to an opaque context (unspecified code from outside the current module) that
may be stateful and therefore store a reference to the escaped closure. Also,
contracts themselves, being predicates wri en in unrestricted Racket, may
exhibit stateful behavior; a sound approach must be robust to contracts which
are arbitrarily expressive and interwoven with the code they monitor. In this
paper, we present and evaluate our solution based on higher-order symbolic
execution, explain the techniques we used to address such thorny issues,
formalize a notion of behavioral approximation, and use it to provide a
mechanized proof of soundness.

"  Existing approaches for restoring weather-degraded images follow a
fully-supervised paradigm and they require paired data for training. However,
collecting paired data for weather degradations is extremely challenging, and
existing methods end up training on synthetic data. To overcome this issue, we
describe an approach for supervising deep networks that are based on CycleGAN,
thereby enabling the use of unlabeled real-world data for training.
Specifically, we introduce new losses for training CycleGAN that lead to more
effective training, resulting in high-quality reconstructions. These new losses
are obtained by jointly modeling the latent space embeddings of predicted clean
images and original clean images through Deep Gaussian Processes. This enables
the CycleGAN architecture to transfer the knowledge from one domain
(weather-degraded) to another (clean) more effectively. We demonstrate that the
proposed method can be effectively applied to different restoration tasks like
de-raining, de-hazing and de-snowing and it outperforms other unsupervised
techniques (that leverage weather-based characteristics) by a considerable

"  If broad absorption line (BAL) quasars represent a high covering fraction
evolutionary state (even if this is not the sole factor governing the presence
of BALs), it is expected that they should show an excess of mid-infrared
radiation compared to normal quasars. Some previous studies have suggested that
this is not the case. We perform the first analysis of the IR properties of
radio-loud BAL quasars, using IR data from WISE and optical (rest-frame
ultraviolet) data from SDSS, and compare the BAL quasar sample with a
well-matched sample of unabsorbed quasars. We find a statistically significant
excess in the mid- to near-infrared luminosities of BAL quasars, particularly
at rest-frame wavelengths of 1.5 and 4 microns. Our sample was previously used
to show that BALs are observed along many lines of sight towards quasars, but
with an overabundance of more edge-on sources, suggesting that orientation
factors into the appearance of BALs. The evidence here---of a difference in IR
luminosities between BAL quasars and unabsorbed quasars---may be ascribed to
evolution. This suggests that a merging of the current BAL paradigms is needed
to fully describe the class.

b.c. in 1<d<4 dimensions. For the Casimir force, finite-size scaling is found
to be valid for all b.c.. For the free energy, finite-size scaling is valid in
1<d<3 and 3<d<4 dimensions for antiperiodic, Neumann, and Dirichlet b.c., but
logarithmic deviations from finite-size scaling exist in d=3 dimensions for
Neumann and Dirichlet b.c.. This is explained in terms of the borderline
dimension d*=3, where the critical exponent of the Gaussian surface energy
density vanishes. For Neumann-Dirichlet b.c., finite-size scaling is strongly
violated above T_c for 1<d<4. Our results include an exact description of the
dimensional crossover between the d-dimensional finite-size critical behavior
near bulk T_c and the (d-1)-dimensional critical behavior near T_c,film(L).
This dimensional crossover is illustrated for the critical behavior of the
specific heat. For 2<d<4, the Gaussian results are reformulated as one-loop
contributions of the phi^4 theory at fixed dimension and are compared with the
epsilon=4-d expansion results as well as with d=3 Monte Carlo data. For d=2,
the Gaussian results for the Casimir force scaling function are compared with
those for the Ising model; unexpected exact relations are found between the
Gaussian and Ising scaling functions. For both the Gaussian and the Ising model
it is shown that anisotropic couplings imply nonuniversal scaling functions of
the Casimir force. Our Gaussian results provide the basis for the investigation

narrow 1D silicon nanowires (NWs). We present a comprehensive analysis of the

confinement on the power factor can be observed is at diameters below 7nm. We
show that contrary to the current view, the effect of confinement and geometry
on the power factor originates mostly from changes in the conductivity which is
strongly affected, rather than the Seebeck coefficient. In general, enhanced
scattering at these diameter scales strongly degrades the conductivity and
power factor of the device. We identify cases, however, for which confinement
largely improves the channel's conductivity, resulting in ~2-3X power factor
improvements. Our results may provide guidance in the design of efficient low

"  The present work investigates the role of contact angle hysteresis at the
liquid-liquid-solid interface (LLS) on the rod climbing effect of two
immiscible Newtonian liquids using experimental and numerical approaches.
Experiments revealed that the final steady state contact angle, $\theta_{w}$ at
the LLS interface varies with the rod rotation speed, $\omega$. For the present
system, $\theta_{w}$ changes from $\sim$69$^{\circ}$ to $\sim$83$^{\circ}$ when
the state of the rod is changed from static condition to rotating at 3.3 Hz.
With further increase in $\omega$, the $\theta_{w}$ exceeds 90$^{\circ}$ which
cannot be observed experimentally. It is inferred from the simulations that the
input value of $\theta_{w}$ saturates and attains a constant value of
$\sim$120$^{\circ}$ for $\omega>$ 5 Hz. Using numerical simulations, we
demonstrate that this contact angle hysteresis must be considered for the
correct prediction of the Newtonian rod climbing effect. Using the appropriate
values of the contact angle in the boundary condition, an excellent
quantitative match between the experiments and simulations is obtained in terms
of: the climbing height, the threshold rod rotation speed for onset of
climbing, and the shape of liquid-liquid interface. This resolves the
discrepancy between the experiments and simulations in the existing literature
where a constant value of the contact angle has been used for all speeds of rod

Abell 63, which is known to contain the eclipsing close-binary nucleus UU Sge.
Abell 63 provides an important test case in investigating the role of
close-binary central stars on the evolution of planetary nebulae.
  Longslit observations were obtained using the Manchester echelle spectrometer
combined with the 2.1-m San Pedro Martir Telescope. The spectra reveal that the
central bright rim of Abell 63 has a tube-like structure. A deep image shows
collimated lobes extending from the nebula, which are shown to be high-velocity
outflows. The kinematic ages of the nebular rim and the extended lobes are
calculated to be 8400+/-500 years and 12900+/-2800 years, respectively, which
suggests that the lobes were formed at an earlier stage than the nebular rim.
This is consistent with expectations that disk-generated jets form immediately
after the common envelope phase.
  A morphological-kinematical model of the central nebula is presented and the
best-fit model is found to have the same inclination as the orbital plane of
the central binary system; this is the first proof that a close-binary system
directly affects the shaping of its nebula. A Hubble-type flow is
well-established in the morphological-kinematical modelling of the observed
line profiles and imagery.

"  It is well known that an inverse turbulent cascade in a finite ($2 \pi \times

of the spatial vorticity profile inside one of the vortices. The exciting force
was shortly correlated in time, random in space, and had a correlation length
$l_f = 2\pi/k_f$ with $k_f$ ranging from $100$ to $12.5$. Previously, it was
found that in the asymptotic limit of small-scale forcing, the vorticity
exhibits the power-law behavior $\Omega(r) = (3 \epsilon/\alpha)^{1/2} r^{-1}$,
where $r$ is the distance to the vortex center, $\alpha$ is the bottom friction
coefficient, and $\epsilon$ is the inverse energy flux. Now we show that for a
spatially homogeneous forcing with finite $k_f$ the vorticity profile becomes
steeper, with the difference increasing with the pumping scale but decreasing
with the Reynolds number at the forcing scale. Qualitatively, this behaviour is
related to a decrease in the effective pumping of the coherent vortex with
distance from its center. To support this statement, we perform an additional
simulation with spatially localized forcing, in which the effective pumping of
the coherent vortex, on the contrary, increases with $r$ and show for the first
time that in this case the vorticity profile can be flatter than the asymptotic
limit.

"  The observational expectation of polarization measurements of thermal dust
radiation is investigated to find information on molecular outflows based on
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) and radiation transfer simulations. There are two
major proposed models for the driving of molecular outflows: (1) molecular gas
is accelerated by a magnetic pressure gradient or magnetocentrifugal wind
mechanism before the magnetic field and molecular gas are decoupled, (2) the
linear momentum of a highly collimated jet is transferred to the ambient
molecular gas. In order to distinguish between these two models, it is crucial
to observe the configuration of the magnetic field. An observation of a
toroidal magnetic field is strong evidence that the first of the models is
appropriate. In this paper, we calculated the polarization distribution of
thermal dust radiation due to the alignment of dust grains along the magnetic
field using molecular outflow data calculated by two-dimensional axisymmetric
MHD simulations. An asymmetric distribution around the z-axis is characteristic
for magnetic fields composed of both poloidal and toroidal components. We
determined that the outflow has a low polarization degree compared with the
envelope and that the envelope and outflow have different polarization
directions (B-vector), namely, the magnetic field within the envelope is
parallel to the global magnetic field lines while the magnetic field of the
outflow is perpendicular to it. Thus we have demonstrated that the
point-symmetric (rather than axisymmetric) distributions of low polarization
regions indicate that molecular outflows are likely to be magnetically driven.
Observations of this polarization distribution with tools such as ALMA would
confirm the origin of the molecular outflow.

"  We present a study of the gas cycle and star formation history in the central
500 pc of the Milky Way, known as Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). Through
hydrodynamical simulations of the inner 4.5 kpc of our Galaxy, we follow the
gas cycle in a completely self-consistent way, starting from gas radial inflow
due to the Galactic bar, the channelling of this gas into a dense, star-forming
ring/stream at ~ 200 - 300 pc from the Galactic centre, and the launching of
galactic outflows powered by stellar feedback. We find that star formation
activity in the CMZ goes through oscillatory burst/quench cycles, with a period
of tens to hundreds of Myr, characterised by roughly constant gas mass but
order-of-magnitude level variations in the star formation rate. Comparison with
the observed present-day star formation rate of the CMZ suggests that we are
currently near a minimum of this cycle. Stellar feedback drives a mainly
two-phase wind off the Galactic disc. The warm phase dominates the mass flux,
and carries 100 - 200 % of the gas mass converted into stars. However, most of
this gas goes into a fountain and falls back onto the disc rather than escaping
the Galaxy. The hot phase carries most of the energy, with a time-averaged
energy outflow rate of 10 - 20 % of the supernova energy budget.

luminosities (~10^{37} - 7 x 10^{37} erg/s). We show that apart from the
fundamental harmonic of the cyclotron absorption line at energy ~11 keV, its
four higher harmonics at energies ~24, 35.6, 48.8, and 60.7 keV are detected in
the spectrum. We have performed a detailed analysis of the source's spectra in
the 4-28 keV energy band based on all of the available RXTE archival data
obtained during bright outbursts in 1995-2011. We have confirmed that modifying
the source's continuum model can lead to the disappearance of the observed
anticorrelation between the energy of the fundamental harmonic of the cyclotron
absorption line and the source's luminosity. Thus, the question about the

understand spreading and invasions in this heterogeneous context. We prove the
existence of a threshold value on the existence of a nonzero asymptotic profile

prove the existence of a traveling front. This allows us to completely identify
the behavior of the solution of the parabolic problem in the KPP case. We also

to an existing CNN architecture which is used to modulate the standard

attentional mechanism that guides the feature extraction process. The main aim
of the proposed approach is to enable the effective training of a fine-grained

on the task, thereby alleviating the need to annotate large dataset. % The vast
majority of saliency methods are evaluated on their ability to generate
saliency maps, and not on their functionality in a complete vision pipeline.
Our proposed pipeline allows to evaluate saliency methods for the high-level
task of object recognition. We perform extensive experiments on various
fine-grained datasets (Flowers, Birds, Cars, and Dogs) under different
conditions and show that saliency can considerably improve the network's
performance, especially for the case of scarce training data. Furthermore, our

measured by traditional saliency benchmarks) also translate to saliency methods
that yield improved performance gains when applied in an object recognition

"  Discrete-time stochastic systems are an essential modelling tool for many
engineering systems. We consider stochastic control systems that are evolving
over continuous spaces. For this class of models, methods for the formal
verification and synthesis of control strategies are computationally hard and
generally rely on the use of approximate abstractions. Building on approximate
abstractions, we compute control strategies with lower- and upper-bounds for
satisfying unbounded temporal logic specifications. Firstly, robust dynamic
programming mappings over the abstract system are introduced to solve the
control synthesis and verification problem. These mappings yield a control
strategy and a unique lower bound on the satisfaction probability for temporal
logic specifications that is robust to the incurred approximation errors.
Secondly, upper-bounds on the satisfaction probability are quantified, and
properties of the mappings are analysed and discussed. Finally, we show the
implications of these results for linear stochastic dynamic systems with a
continuous state space. This abstraction-based synthesis framework is shown to
be able to handle infinite-horizon properties. Approximation errors expressed
as deviations in the outputs of the models and as deviations in the
probabilistic transitions are allowed and are quantified using approximate
stochastic simulation relations.

optical and X-ray properties (derived from the spectral analysis of the

the X-ray band (NH<1.3x10^20 cm^-2). In total, 7 sources out of 27 are heavily

"  To explain the origin of Herbig Ae/Be stars activity, it has been recently
proposed that strong mass-losses trigger rotational instabilities in the
envelope of fast rotating stars. The kinetic energy transferred to turbulent
motions would then be the energy source of the active phenomena observed in the
outer atmosphere of Herbig Ae/Be stars (Vigneron et al. 1990; Lignieres et al.
1996).
  In this paper, we present a one-dimensional model of angular momentum
transport which allows to estimate the degree of differential rotation induced
by mass-loss. Gradients of angular velocity are very close to - 2 \Omega / R
(\Omega being the surface rotation rate and R the stellar radius). For strong
mass-loss, this process occurs in a short time scale as compared to other
processes of angular momentum transport. Application of existing stability
criteria indicates that rotational instabilities should develop for fast
rotating star. Thus, in fast rotating stars with strong winds, shear
instabilities are expected to develop and to generate subphotospheric turbulent
motions. Albeit very simple, this model gives strong support to the assumption
made by Vigneron et al. 1990 and Lignieres et al. 1996.

  To improve generality, this paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC)

discrete human goals, human kinematics, safety constraints, contact stability,
and frequency-domain disturbance rejection. This MPC formulation is introduced,
analyzed with respect to convexity, and validated in co-manipulation with

from the inversion by means of planar cuts through the differential opacity 3D

and represents their distribution at the spatial resolution that is allowed by
the dataset properties, i.e. of the order of ~10 pc close to the Sun and
increasing to ~100 pc beyond 1 kpc. Biases towards nearby and/or weakly
extincted stars make this dataset particularly appropriate to map the local and
neighboring cavities, and to locate faint, extended nearby clouds, both goals
that are difficult or impossible with other mapping methods. The new maps
reveal a ~1 kpc wide empty region in the third quadrant in the continuation of

as this practice tries to address two difficult and inherently different

spectrum and the spectral radius of matrices in $\mathbb{T}_{G} $. We identify
a class of connected graphs $\mathfrak{F^{'}}$ such that for each $G \in
\mathfrak{F^{'}}$, the matrices in $\mathbb{T}_G$ have nonnegative real part up
to diagonal unitary similarity. Then we establish bounds for the spectral
radius of $\mathbb{T}$-gain adjacency matrices on $ G \in \mathfrak{F^{'}} $ in
terms of their largest eigenvalues. Thereupon, we characterize
$\mathbb{T}$-gain graphs for which the spectral radius of the associated
$\mathbb{T}$-gain adjacency matrices equal to the largest vertex degree of the
underlying graph. These bounds generalize results known for the spectral radius
of Hermitian adjacency matrices of digraphs and provide an alternate proof of a
result about the sharpness of the bound in terms of largest vertex degree
established in [Krystal Guo, Bojan Mohar. Hermitian adjacency matrix of
digraphs and mixed graphs. J. Graph Theory 85 (2017), no. 1, 217-248.].

"  A high-throughput experimental approach is presented to extract the
anisotropic interdiffusion coefficient by combining information over the
composition profiles obtained by the electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and
the grain orientation spectrum by the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)
on polycrystalline diffusion couples. Following the forward-simulation scheme,
the interdiffusion coefficients in grains with diverse orientation are obtained
and subsequently used to determine the anisotropic interdiffusion coefficients
perpendicular (D_\perp (x)) and parallel (D_\parallel (x)) to the c axis of the
hcp Mg lattice in a Mg-Al alloy as a function of the Al solute content at 673 K
and 723 K, respectively. It was found that the interdiffusion coefficients
generally increased with the Al content and the rotation angle with respect to
the c axis with a valley point around {\theta} approx 30 {\deg} at 723 K. And
it was noticed that diffusion along the basal plane was always faster than
along the c axis. A comprehensive explicit expression of the interdiffusion
coefficients was provided as a function of Al content, grain orientation and
temperature. The anisotropic impurity diffusion coefficients of Al in hcp Mg
derived by the extrapolation of the results in this paper are in good agreement
with first principles calculations in the literature.

"  Measurements of the properties of gravitational lenses have the power to tell
us what sort of universe we live in. The brightest known radio Einstein
ring/gravitational lens PKS 1830-211 (Jauncey et al., 1991), whilst obscured by
our Galaxy at optical wavelengths, has recently been shown to contain
absorption at the millimetre waveband at a redshift of 0.89 (Wiklind and
Combes, 1996a). We report the detection of a new absorption feature, most
likely due to neutral hydrogen in a second redshift system at z = 0.19.
Follow-up VLBI observations have spatially resolved the absorption and reveal
it to cover the NE compact component and part of the lower surface brightness
ring. This new information, together with existing evidence of the unusual VLBI
radio structure and difficulties in modeling the lensing system, points to the
existence of a second lensing galaxy along our line of sight and implies that
PKS 1830-211 may be a compound gravitational lens.

"  Topological insulators (TIs) containing 4f electrons have recently attracted
intensive interests due to the possible interplay of their non-trivial
topological properties and strong electronic correlations. YbB6 and SmB6 are
the prototypical systems with such unusual properties, which may be tuned by
external pressure to give rise to new emergent phenomena. Here, we report the
first observation, through in-situ high pressure resistance, Hall, X-ray
diffraction and X-ray absorption measurements, of two pressure-induced quantum
phase transitions (QPTs) in YbB6. Our data revealthat the two insulating phases
are separated by a metallic phase due to the pressure-driven valence change of
Yb f-orbitals. In combination with previous studies, our results suggest that
the two insulating states may be topologically different in nature and
originate from the d-p and d-f hybridization, respectively. The tunable
topological properties of YbB6 revealed in this study may shed light on the
intriguing correlation between the topology and the 4f electrons from the

"  Using geometric algebra and calculus to express the laws of electromagnetism
we are able to present magnitudes and relations in a gradual way, escalating
the number of dimensions. In the one-dimensional case, charge and current
densities, the electric field E and the scalar and vector potentials get a
geometric interpretation in spacetime diagrams. The geometric vector derivative
applied to these magnitudes yields simple expressions leading to concepts like
displacement current, continuity and gauge or retarded time, with a clear
geometric meaning. As the geometric vector derivative is invertible, we
introduce simple Green's functions and, with this, it is possible to obtain
retarded Li\'enard-Wiechert potentials propagating naturally at the speed of
light. In two dimensions, these magnitudes become more complex, and a magnetic
field B appears as a pseudoscalar which was absent in the one-dimensional
world. The laws of induction reflect the relations between E and B, and it is
possible to arrive to the concepts of capacitor, electric circuit and Poynting
vector, explaining the flow of energy. The solutions to the wave equations in
this two-dimensional scenario uncover now the propagation of physical effects
at the speed of light. This anticipates the same results in the real
three-dimensional world, but endowed in this case with a nature which is
totally absent in one or three dimensions. Electromagnetic waves propagating
entirely at the speed of light can thus be viewed as a consequence of living in
a world with an odd number of spatial dimensions. Finally, in the real
three-dimensional world the same set of simple multivector differential
expressions encode the fundamental laws and concepts of electromagnetism.

"  Galaxies cover a wide range of masses and star formation histories. In this
review, I summarize some of the evolutionary key features of common galaxy
types. At the high-mass end, very rapid, efficient early star formation is
observed, accompanied by strong enrichment and later quiescence, well-described
by downsizing scenarios. In the intermediate-mass regime, early-type galaxies
may still show activity in low-mass environments or when being rejuvenated by
wet mergers. In late-type galaxies, we find continuous, though variable star
formation over a Hubble time. In the dwarf regime, a wide range of properties
from bursty activity to quiescence is observed. Generally, stochasticity
dominates here, and star formation rates and efficiencies tend to be low.
Morphological types and their star formation properties correlate with

"  The 18 mag QSO 1633+382 (4C38.41, z=1.807) showed a very pronounced outburst
in 2001/2002. With a peak amplitude of more than 9 Jy at 90GHz, this flare was
brighter than any known previous flare in this source (data available since
1980).During onset, the mm-flare was particulary fast, with an increase of more
than 2 Jy at 230 GHz in less than 8 days. Since January 2002, the mm-flux of
1633+382 is decaying. During this decline, however, local flux variations with
amplitudes of 1-3 Jy were seen, indicative of underlying and more rapid source

"  In our previous articles (Chertok et al.: 2013, Solar Phys. 282, 175, and
2015, Solar Phys. 290, 627), we presented a preliminary tool for the early
diagnostics of the geoeffectiveness of solar eruptions based on the estimate of
the total unsigned line-of-sight photospheric magnetic flux in accompanying
extreme-ultraviolet arcades and dimmings. This tool was based on the analysis
of eruptions observed in 1996-2005 with SOHO/EIT and MDI. Empirical
relationships were obtained to estimate the probable importance of upcoming
space weather disturbances caused by an eruption, which just occurred, without
data on the associated coronal mass ejections. It was possible to estimate the
intensity of a non-recurrent geomagnetic storm (GMS) and Forbush decrease (FD),
as well as their onset and peak times. After 2010-2011, data on solar eruptions
are obtained with SDO/AIA and HMI. We use relatively short intervals of
overlapping EIT-AIA and MDI-HMI detailed observations and a number of large
eruptions over the next five years with the 12-hour cadence EIT images to adapt
the SOHO diagnostic tool to SDO data. The adopted brightness thresholds select
from the EIT 195 \AA\ and AIA 193 \AA\ image practically the same areas of
arcades and dimmings with a cross-calibration factor of 3.6-5.8 (5.0-8.2) for
the AIA exposure time of 2.0 s (2.9 s). For the same photospheric areas, the
MDI magnetic flux systematically exceeds the HMI flux by a factor of 1.4. Based
on these results, the empirical diagnostic relationships obtained from SOHO
data are adjusted to SDO instruments. Examples of a post-diagnostics based on
SDO data are presented. As before, the tool is applicable to non-recurrent GMSs
and FDs caused by nearly central eruptions from active regions, provided that
the southern component of the interplanetary magnetic field near the Earth is
predominantly negative, which is not predicted by this tool.

"  We consider the problem of online learning in misspecified linear stochastic
multi-armed bandit problems. Regret guarantees for state-of-the-art linear
bandit algorithms such as Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty Linear bandit
(OFUL) hold under the assumption that the arms expected rewards are perfectly
linear in their features. It is, however, of interest to investigate the impact
of potential misspecification in linear bandit models, where the expected
rewards are perturbed away from the linear subspace determined by the arms
features. Although OFUL has recently been shown to be robust to relatively
small deviations from linearity, we show that any linear bandit algorithm that
enjoys optimal regret performance in the perfectly linear setting (e.g., OFUL)
must suffer linear regret under a sparse additive perturbation of the linear
model. In an attempt to overcome this negative result, we define a natural
class of bandit models characterized by a non-sparse deviation from linearity.
We argue that the OFUL algorithm can fail to achieve sublinear regret even
under models that have non-sparse deviation.We finally develop a novel bandit
algorithm, comprising a hypothesis test for linearity followed by a decision to
use either the OFUL or Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. For perfectly
linear bandit models, the algorithm provably exhibits OFULs favorable regret
performance, while for misspecified models satisfying the non-sparse deviation
property, the algorithm avoids the linear regret phenomenon and falls back on
UCBs sublinear regret scaling. Numerical experiments on synthetic data, and on
recommendation data from the public Yahoo! Learning to Rank Challenge dataset,
empirically support our findings.

"  We investigate elastic wave propagation in finitely deformed dielectric
elastomers in the presence of an electrostatic field. To analyze the
propagation of both longitudinal (P-) and transverse (S-) waves, we utilize
compressible material models. We derive explicit expressions of the generalized
acoustic tensor and phase velocities of elastic waves for the ideal and
enriched dielectric elastomer models. We analyze the slowness curves of the
elastic wave propagation, and find the P-S-mode disentangling phenomenon. In
particular, P- and S- waves are separated by the application of an electric
field. The divergence angle between P- and S-waves strongly depends on the
applied electrostatic excitation. The influence of the electric field is
sensitive to material models. Thus, for ideal dielectric model the in-plane
shear velocity increases with an increase in electric field, while for the
enriched model the velocity may decreases depending on material constants.
Similarly, the divergence angle gradually increases with an increase in
electric field, while for the enriched model, the angle may be bounded.
Material compressibility affects the P-wave velocity, and, for relatively
compressible materials, the slowness curves evolve from circular to elliptical
shapes manifesting in an increase of the reflection angle of P-waves. As a
results, the divergence angle decreases with an increase in material
compressibility.

"  The origin of ultra-intense magnetic fields on magnetars is a mystery in
modern astrophysics. We model the core collapse dynamics of massive progenitor
stars with high surface magnetic fields in the theoretical framework of a
self-similar general polytropic magnetofluid under the self-gravity with a
quasi-spherical symmetry. With the specification of physical parameters such as
mass density, temperature, magnetic field and wind mass loss rate on the
progenitor stellar surface and the consideration of a rebound shock breaking
through the stellar interior and envelope, we find a remnant compact object
(i.e. neutron star) left behind at the centre with a radius of $\sim 10^6$ cm
and a mass range of $\sim 1-3$ solar masses. Moreover, we find that surface
magnetic fields of such kind of compact objects can be $\sim 10^{14}-10^{15}$
G, consistent with those inferred for magnetars which include soft gamma-ray
repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs). The magnetic field
enhancement factor critically depends on the self-similar scaling index $n$,
which also determines the initial density distribution of the massive
progenitor. We propose that magnetized massive stars as magnetar progenitors
based on the magnetohydrodynamic evolution of the gravitational core collapse
and rebound shock. Our physical mechanism, which does not necessarily require
ad hoc dynamo amplification within a fast spinning neutron star, favours the
`fossil field' scenario of forming magnetars from the strongly magnetized core
collapse inside massive progenitor stars. With a range of surface magnetic
field strengths over massive progenitor stars, our scenario allows a continuum
of magnetic field strengths from pulsars to magnetars.

"  Optical pumping of solids creates a non-equilibrium electronic structure
where electrons and photons combine to form quasiparticles of dressed
electronic states. The resulting shift of electronic levels is known as the
optical Stark effect, visible as a red shift in the optical spectrum. Here we
show that in a pump-probe setup we can uniquely define a non-equilibrium
quasiparticle bandstructure that can be directly measurable with photo-electron
spectroscopy. The dynamical photon-dressing (and undressing) of the many-body
electronic states can be monitored by pump-probe time and angular resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) as the photon-dressed bandstructure
evolves in time depending on the pump-probe pulse overlap. The computed
tr-ARPES spectrum agrees perfectly with the quasi-energy spectrum of Floquet
theory at maximum overlap and goes to the the equilibrium bandstructure as the
pump-probe overlap goes to zero. Additionally, we show how this time-dependent
non-equilibrium quasiparticle structure can be understood to be the
bandstructure underlying the optical Stark effect. The extension to
spin-resolved PES can be used to predict asymmetric dichroic response linked to
the valley selective optical excitations in monolayer transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs).

tomographic redshift binning can enhance the cosmological gains. We also
perform detailed studies about the degradation of cosmological information due
to photometric redshift (photo-z) errors. We show that for surveys with the
number density of galaxies $\sim40\,{\rm arcmin^{-2}}$, the median redshift
$\sim1$, and the survey area of $\sim15000\,{\rm deg^{2}}$, the 4-bin
tomographic peak analyses can reduce the error contours of $(\Omega_{{\rm

case of photo-z error being absent. More redshift bins can hardly lead to
significantly better constraints. The photo-z error model here is parametrized
by $z_{{\rm bias}}$ and $\sigma_{{\rm ph}}$ and the fiducial values of $z_{{\rm

tomographic peak analyses can constrain the photo-z errors simultaneously with
cosmological parameters. For 4-bin analyses, we can obtain $\sigma(z_{{\rm

constraints on $\Omega_{{\rm m}}$ and $\sigma_{8}$ degrade by a factor of
$\sim2.2$ and $\sim1.8$, respectively, with respect to zero uncertainties on
photo-z parameters. We find that the uncertainty of $z_{{\rm bias}}$ plays more
significant roles in degrading the cosmological constraints than that of

determined by the parameter $\sigma_v$ used for quasar environment

planets in million-solar-mass clumps as the dark matter of galaxies and the
hosts of first life. Photon viscous forces in the expanding universe of the
turbulent big bang prevent fragmentations of the plasma for mass scales smaller
than protogalaxies. At the plasma to gas transition 300,000 years after the big
bang, the 10^7 decrease in kinematic viscosity {\nu} explains why ~3x10^7
planets are observed to exist per star in typical galaxies like the Milky Way,
not eight or nine. Stars form by a binary accretional cascade from Earth-mass
primordial planets to progressively larger masses that collect and recycle the
stardust chemicals of life produced when stars overeat and explode. The
astonishing complexity of molecular biology observed on Earth is possible to
explain only if enormous numbers of primordial planets and their fragments have
hosted the formation and wide scattering of the seeds of life virtually from
the beginning of time. Geochemical and biological evidence suggests that life
on Earth appears at the earliest moment it can survive, in highly evolved forms
with complexity requiring a time scale in excess of the age of the galaxy. This
is quite impossible within standard cold-dark-matter cosmology where planets
are relatively recent, rare and cold, completely lacking mechanisms for
intergalactic transport of life forms.

"  There exists a token imbalance phenomenon in natural language as different
tokens appear with different frequencies, which leads to different learning
difficulties for tokens in Neural Machine Translation (NMT). The vanilla NMT
model usually adopts trivial equal-weighted objectives for target tokens with
different frequencies and tends to generate more high-frequency tokens and less
low-frequency tokens compared with the golden token distribution. However,
low-frequency tokens may carry critical semantic information that will affect
the translation quality once they are neglected. In this paper, we explored
target token-level adaptive objectives based on token frequencies to assign
appropriate weights for each target token during training. We aimed that those
meaningful but relatively low-frequency words could be assigned with larger
weights in objectives to encourage the model to pay more attention to these
tokens. Our method yields consistent improvements in translation quality on
ZH-EN, EN-RO, and EN-DE translation tasks, especially on sentences that contain
more low-frequency tokens where we can get 1.68, 1.02, and 0.52 BLEU increases
compared with baseline, respectively. Further analyses show that our method can
also improve the lexical diversity of translation.

"  Baryonic streaming motions produced prior to the epoch of recombination
became supersonic during the cosmic dark ages. Various studies suggest that
such streaming velocities change the halo statistics and also influence the
formation of Population III stars. In this study, we aim to explore the impact
of streaming velocities on the formation of supermassive black holes at $z>10$
via the direct collapse scenario. To accomplish this goal, we perform
cosmological large eddy simulations for two halos of a few times $\rm 10^{7}
M_{\odot}$ with initial streaming velocities of 3, 6 and 9 $\rm km/s$. These
massive primordial halos illuminated by the strong Lyman Werner flux are the
potential cradles for the formation of direct collapse seed black holes. To
study the evolution for longer times, we employ sink particles and track the
accretion for 10,000 years. Our findings show that higher streaming velocities
increase the circular velocities from about 14 $\rm km/s$ to 16 $\rm km/s$.
They also delay the collapse of halos for a few million years, but do not have
any significant impact on the halo properties such as turbulent energy, radial
velocity, density and accretion rates. Sink particles of about $\rm \sim 10^5
M_{\odot}$ are formed at the end of our simulations and no clear distribution
of sink masses is observed in the presence of streaming motions. It is further
found that the impact of streaming velocities is less severe in massive halos
compared to the minihalos as reported in the previous studies.

during 1998-2000. Two photometric periodicities were present in the light curve

probably the orbital period of the underlying binary system, and a second one
of lower coherence, approximately 2.5 per cent longer than the former. The
latter periodicity may be a permanent superhump, or alternatively, the spin
period of the white dwarf in a nearly synchronous magnetic system. A third
period, at P=5.06 d, corresponding to the beat between the two periods was
probably present in 1999. Our results suggest that a process of mass transfer
took place in the binary system since no later than two and a half months after
the nova eruption. We derive an interstellar reddening of E(B-V)~0.21 from our
spectroscopic measurements and published photometric data, and estimate a

"  Region Proposal Network (RPN) is the cornerstone of two-stage object
detectors, it generates a sparse set of object proposals and alleviates the
extrem foregroundbackground class imbalance problem during training. However,
we find that the potential of the detector has not been fully exploited due to
the IoU distribution imbalance and inadequate quantity of the training samples
generated by RPN. With the increasing intersection over union (IoU), the
exponentially smaller numbers of positive samples would lead to the
distribution skewed towards lower IoUs, which hinders the optimization of
detector at high IoU levels. In this paper, to break through the limitations of
RPN, we propose IoU-Uniform R-CNN, a simple but effective method that directly
generates training samples with uniform IoU distribution for the regression
branch as well as the IoU prediction branch. Besides, we improve the
performance of IoU prediction branch by eliminating the feature offsets of RoIs
at inference, which helps the NMS procedure by preserving accurately localized
bounding box. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO dataset show
the effectiveness of our method, as well as its compatibility and adaptivity to
many object detection architectures. The code is made publicly available at

"  The well-known problem of state space explosion in model checking is even
more critical when applying this technique to programming languages, mainly due
to the presence of complex data structures. One recent and promising approach
to deal with this problem is the construction of an abstract and correct
representation of the global program state allowing to match visited states
during program model exploration. In particular, one powerful method to
implement abstract matching is to fill the state vector with a minimal amount
of relevant variables for each program point. In this paper, we combine the
on-the-fly model-checking approach (incremental construction of the program
state space) and the static analysis method called influence analysis
(extraction of significant variables for each program point) in order to
automatically construct an abstract matching function. Firstly, we describe the
problem as an alternation-free value-based mu-calculus formula, whose validity
can be checked on the program model expressed as a labeled transition system
(LTS). Secondly, we translate the analysis into the local resolution of a
parameterised boolean equation system (PBES), whose representation enables a
more efficient construction of the resulting abstract matching function.
Finally, we show how our proposal may be elegantly integrated into CADP, a
generic framework for both the design and analysis of distributed systems and
the development of verification tools.

an extra-mixing process, similar to those apparently operating in RGB stars.

"  To support the growing demands of neuroscience applications, researchers are
transitioning to cloud computing for its scalable, robust and elastic
infrastructure. Nevertheless, large datasets residing in object stores may
result in significant data transfer overheads during workflow execution.
Prefetching, a method to mitigate the cost of reading in mixed workloads, masks
data transfer costs within processing time of prior tasks. We present an
implementation of ""Rolling Prefetch"", a Python library that implements a
particular form of prefetching from AWS S3 object store, and we quantify its
benefits.
  Rolling Prefetch extends S3Fs, a Python library exposing AWS S3 functionality
via a file object, to add prefetch capabilities. In measured analysis
performance of a 500 GB brain connectivity dataset stored on S3, we found that
prefetching provides significant speed-ups of up to 1.86x, even in applications
consisting entirely of data loading. The observed speed-up values are
consistent with our theoretical analysis. Our results demonstrate the
usefulness of prefetching for scientific data processing on cloud
infrastructures and provide an implementation applicable to various application

"  The magnetic ground state of nanosized systems such as Fe double chains,
recently shown to form in the early stages of Fe deposition on Ir(100), is
generally nontrivial. Using ab initio density functional theory we find that
the straight ferromagnetic (FM) state typical of bulk Fe as well as of isolated
Fe chains and double chains is disfavored after deposition on Ir(100) for all
the experimentally relevant double chain structures considered. So long as
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is neglected, the double chain lowest energy state is
generally antiferromagnetic (AFM), a state which appears to prevail over the FM
state due to Fe-Ir hybridization. Successive inclusion of SOC adds two further
elements, namely a magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
(DM) spin-spin interaction, the former stabilizing the collinear AFM state, the
second favoring a long-period spin modulation. We find that anisotropy is most
important when the double chain is adsorbed on the partially deconstructed
Ir(100) -- a state which we find to be substantially lower in energy than any
reconstructed structure -- so that in this case the Fe double chain should
remain collinear AFM. Alternatively, when the same Fe double chain is adsorbed
in a metastable state onto the (5x1) fully reconstructed Ir(100) surface, the
FM-AFM energy difference is very much reduced and the DM interaction is
expected to prevail, probably yielding a helical spin structure.

"  Current Induced Resistance Switching (CIS) was recently observed in thin
tunnel junctions with ferromagnetic (FM) electrodes \emph{i.e} FM/I/FM. This
effect was attributed to electromigration of metallic atoms in
nanoconstrictions in the insulating barrier (I). Here we study how the CIS
effect is influenced by a thin non-magnetic (NM) Ta layer, deposited just below
the AlO$_x$ insulating barrier in tunnel junctions of the type FM/NM/I/FM
(FM=CoFe). Enhanced resistance switching occurs with increasing maximum applied
current ($\Imax$), until a plateau of constant CIS is reached for $\Imax\sim65$
mA (CIS$\sim$60%) and above. However, such high electrical currents also lead
to a large ($\sim$9%) irreversible resistance decrease, indicating barrier
degradation. Anomalous voltage-current characteristics with negative derivative
were also observed near $\pm\Imax$ and this effect is here attributed to
heating in the tunnel junction. One observes that the current direction for
which resistance switches in FM/NM/I/FM (clockwise) is opposite to that of
FM/I/FM tunnel junctions (anti-clockwise). This effect will be discussed in
terms of a competition between the electromigration contributions due to the so
called direct and wind forces. It will be shown that the direct force is likely
to dominate electromigration in the Ta (NM) layers, while the wind contribution
likely dominates in the CoFe (FM) layers.

"  This paper presents a compact and accurate representation of 3D scenes that
are observed by a LiDAR sensor and a monocular camera. The proposed method is
based on the well-established Stixel model originally developed for stereo
vision applications. We extend this Stixel concept to incorporate data from
multiple sensor modalities. The resulting mid-level fusion scheme takes full
advantage of the geometric accuracy of LiDAR measurements as well as the high
resolution and semantic detail of RGB images. The obtained environment model
provides a geometrically and semantically consistent representation of the 3D
scene at a significantly reduced amount of data while minimizing information
loss at the same time. Since the different sensor modalities are considered as
input to a joint optimization problem, the solution is obtained with only minor
computational overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
multimodal Stixel algorithm on a manually annotated ground truth dataset. Our
results indicate that the proposed mid-level fusion of LiDAR and camera data
improves both the geometric and semantic accuracy of the Stixel model
significantly while reducing the computational overhead as well as the amount
of generated data in comparison to using a single modality on its own.

"  We use testing to check if a combinational circuit N always evaluates to 0.
The usual point of view is that to prove that N always evaluates to 0 one has
to check the value of N for all 2^|X| input assignments where X is the set of
input variables of N. We use the notion of a Stable Set of Assignments (SSA) to
show that one can build a complete test set (i.e. a test set proving that N
always evaluates to 0) that consists of less than 2^|X| tests. Given an
unsatisfiable CNF formula H(W), an SSA of H is a set of assignments to W
proving unsatisfiability of H. A trivial SSA is the set of all 2^|W|
assignments to W. Importantly, real-life formulas can have SSAs that are much
smaller than 2^|W|. Generating a complete test set for N using only the
machinery of SSAs is inefficient. We describe a much faster algorithm that
combines computation of SSAs with resolution derivation and produces a complete
test set for a ""projection"" of N on a subset of variables of N. We give
experimental results and describe potential applications of this algorithm.

the mechanisms potentially responsible for their inner holes. Following our
previous studies in other regions, we combine disk masses, accretion rates and
multiplicity data with other information, such as SED morphology and fractional
disk luminosity to classify the disks as strong candidates for the following
categories: grain-growth dominated disks (7 objects), giant planet-forming

"  We investigate the evolution of the galaxy Star Formation Rate Function
(SFRF) and Cosmic Star Formation Rate Density (CSFRD) of $z\sim 0-8 $ galaxies
in the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE)
simulations. In addition, we present a compilation of UV, IR and H$\alpha$
SFRFs and compare these with the predictions from the EAGLE suite of
cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the constraints implied by
different indicators are inconsistent with each other for the highest
star-forming objects at z < 2, a problem that is possibly related to selection
biases and the uncertainties of dust attenuation effects. EAGLE's feedback
parameters were calibrated to reproduce realistic galaxy sizes and stellar
masses at z = 0.1. In this work we test if and why those choices yield
realistic Star Formation Rates (SFRs) for $z \sim 0-8$ as well. We demonstrate
that SNe feedback plays a major role at setting the abundance of galaxies at
all star-forming regimes, especially at high redshifts. On the contrary, Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback becomes more prominent at lower redshifts and is
a major mechanism that affects only the highest star-forming systems.
Furthermore, we find that galaxies with SFR $\sim 1-10 \, {\rm M_{\odot} \,
yr^{-1}}$ dominate the CSFRD at redshifts z < 5, while rare high star-forming
galaxies (SFR $\sim 10-100 \,{\rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}}$) contribute
significantly only briefly around the peak era ($z \sim 2$) and then are
quenched by AGN feedback. In the absence of this prescription objects with SFR
$\sim 10-100 \,{\rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}}$ would dominate the CSFRD, while the
cosmic budget of star formation would be extremely high. Finally, we
demonstrate that the majority of the cosmic star formation occurs in relatively
rare high mass halos ($ {\rm M_{Halo}} \sim 10^{11-13} \, {\rm M_{\odot}}$)
even at the earliest epochs.

dark energy equation of state parameter ($\Lambda$CDM + $M_\nu$ +
$\left(w_0,w_a \right)$). We compare the sensitivity of 14 different
combinations of cosmological probes and experimental configurations. For Euclid
combined with Planck, assuming a plain cosmological constant, our method gives
robust predictions for a high sensitivity to the primordial spectral index
$n_{\rm s}$ ($\sigma(n_s)=0.00085$), the Hubble constant $H_0$
($\sigma(H_0)=0.141 \, {\rm km/s/Mpc}$), the total neutrino mass $M_\nu$
($\sigma(M_\nu)=0.020 \, {\rm eV}$). Assuming dynamical dark energy we get
$\sigma(M_\nu)=0.030 \, {\rm eV}$ for the mass and $(\sigma(w_0), \sigma(w_a))
= (0.0214, 0.071)$ for the equation of state parameters. The predicted
sensitivity to $M_\nu$ is mostly stable against the extensions of the
cosmological model considered here. Interestingly, a significant improvement of
the constraints on the extended model parameters is also obtained when
combining Euclid with a low redshift HI intensity mapping survey by SKA1,
demonstrating the importance of the synergy of Euclid and SKA.

"  Empirical constraints of fundamental properties of protoplanetary disks are
essential for understanding planet formation and planetary properties (1,2).
Carbon monoxide (CO) gas is often used to constrain disk properties (3).
However, estimates show that the CO gas abundance in disks is depleted relative
to expected values (4,5,6,7), and models of various disk processes impacting
the CO abundance could not explain this depletion on observed 1Myr timescales
(8,9,10,11,12,13,14). Here we demonstrate that surface energy effects on
particles in disks, such as the Kelvin effect, that arise when ice
heterogeneously nucleates onto an existing particle can efficiently trap CO in
its ice phase. In previous ice formation models, CO gas was released when small
ice-coated particles were lofted to warmed disk layers. Our model can reproduce
the observed abundance, distribution and time evolution of gaseous CO in the
four most studied protoplanetary disks (7). We constrain the solid and gaseous
CO inventory at the midplane and disk diffusivities and resolve inconsistencies
in estimates of the disk mass -- three crucial parameters that control
planetary formation.

"  Bilateral filter (BF) is a fast, lightweight and effective tool for image
denoising and well extended to point cloud denoising. However, it often
involves continual yet manual parameter adjustment; this inconvenience
discounts the efficiency and user experience to obtain satisfied denoising
results. We propose LBF, an end-to-end learnable bilateral filtering network
for point cloud denoising; to our knowledge, this is the first time. Unlike the
conventional BF and its variants that receive the same parameters for a whole
point cloud, LBF learns adaptive parameters for each point according its
geometric characteristic (e.g., corner, edge, plane), avoiding remnant noise,
wrongly-removed geometric details, and distorted shapes. Besides the learnable
paradigm of BF, we have two cores to facilitate LBF. First, different from the
local BF, LBF possesses a global-scale feature perception ability by exploiting
multi-scale patches of each point. Second, LBF formulates a geometry-aware
bi-directional projection loss, leading the denoising results to being faithful
to their underlying surfaces. Users can apply our LBF without any laborious
parameter tuning to achieve the optimal denoising results. Experiments show
clear improvements of LBF over its competitors on both synthetic and
real-scanned datasets.

"  We perform two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations of cold, dense
clouds, which are accelerated by radiation pressure on dust relative to a hot,
diffuse background gas. We examine the relative effectiveness of acceleration
by ultraviolet and infrared radiation fields, both independently and acting
simultaneously on the same cloud. We study clouds that are optically thin to
infrared emission but with varying ultraviolet optical depths. Consistent with
previous work, we find relatively efficient acceleration and long cloud
survival times when the infrared band flux dominates over the ultraviolet flux.
However, when ultraviolet is dominant or even a modest percentage ($\sim
5-10$\%) of the infrared irradiating flux, it can act to compress the cloud,
first crushing it and then disrupting the outer layers. This drives mixing of
outer regions of the dusty gas with the hot diffuse background to the point
where most dust is not likely to survive or stay coupled to the gas. Hence, the
cold cloud is unable to survive for a long enough timescale to experience
significant acceleration before disruption even though efficient infrared
cooling keeps the majority of the gas close to radiative equilibrium
temperature ($T \lesssim 100$K). We discuss implications for observed systems,
concluding that radiation pressure driving is most effective when the light
from star-forming regions is efficiently reprocessed into the infrared.

spectral lines, the Lyman-$\alpha$ line of neutral hydrogen at 121.6 nm (the
strongest line of the solar UV spectrum) being of particular interest given its
sensitivity to the Hanle effect (the magnetic-field-induced modification of the

fact, the observed spatial variation from disk to limb of polarization at the

"  The emergence of unconventional superconductivity in proximity to intertwined

"  Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a
fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve
extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw
during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply
changing the position representation method, though we find that current
methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a
simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases
(ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead,
it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to
their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model

length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding
model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11%
less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform
multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.

"  In this work we presented a novel computational model of precipitation
polymerization allowing one to obtain core-shell microgels via a realistic

cross-linker-monomer reactivity ratios r are responsible for the microgel
internal structure. Values of r lower than 1 correspond to the case when
alternating sequences occur at the early reaction stages; this leads to the
formation of microgels with pronounced core-shell structure. The distribution
of dangling ends for small values of r becomes bimodal with two
well-distinguished peaks, which correspond to the core (short dangling ends)
and corona (long dangling ends) regions. The density profiles confirm the
existence of two distinct regions for small r: a densely cross-linked core and
a loose corona entirely consisting of dangling ends with no cross-linker. The
consumption of the cross-linker in the course in the microgel formation was
found to be in a perfect agreement with the predictions of Monte Carlo (MC)

"  Active nematic fluids confined in narrow channels generate spontaneous flows
when the activity is sufficiently intense. Recently, it was shown that if the
molecular anchoring at the channel walls is conflicting flows are initiated
even in the zero activity limit. An analytical laminar velocity profile for
this specific configuration was derived within a simplified nematohydrodynamic
model in which the nematic order parameter is a fixed-magnitude unit vector n.
In this study we explore systematically active flows in this confined geometry
with a more general theoretical model that uses a second-rank tensor order
parameter Q to express both the magnitude and orientation of the nematic phase.
The Q-model allows for the presence of defects and biaxial, in addition to
uniaxial, molecular arrangements. Our aim is to provide a unified picture,
beyond the limiting regime explored previously, to serve as a guide for
potential microfluidic applications. We reveal how the nematic-flow coupling is
not only dependent on geometrical constraints but also highly sensitive to
material and flow parameters. We specifically stress the key role played by the
activity and the flow aligning parameter and we show that solutions depend on
two dimensionless parameters. We find that for large values of the activity
parameter the flow is suppressed for contractile particles while is either
sustained or suppressed for extensile particles depending on whether they tend
to align or tumble when subject to shear. We explain these distinct behaviors
by an argument based on the results of the stability analysis applied to
simpler configurations. We finally provide a numerical example of a biaxial
three-dimensional thresholdless active flow for which we show that biaxiality
is specially relevant for a weakly first-order isotropic-nematic phase
transition.

"  The turbulent cross helicity is directly related to the coupling coefficients
for the mean vorticity in the electromotive force and for the mean
magnetic-field strain in the Reynolds stress tensor. This suggests that the
cross-helicity effects are important in the cases where global inhomogeneous
flow and magnetic-field structures are present. Since such large-scale
structures are ubiquitous in geo/astrophysical phenomena, the cross-helicity
effect is expected to play an important role in geo/astrophysical flows. In the
presence of turbulent cross helicity, the mean vortical motion contributes to
the turbulent electromotive force. Magnetic-field generation due to this effect
is called the cross-helicity dynamo. Several features of the cross-helicity
dynamo are introduced. Unlike the case in the helicity or $\alpha$ effect,
where ${\bf{J}}$ is aligned with ${\bf{B}}$ in the turbulent electromotive
force, we in general have a finite mean-field Lorentz force ${\bf{J}} \times
{\bf{B}}$ in the cross-helicity dynamo. This gives a distinguished feature of
the cross-helicity effect. By considering the effects of cross helicity in the
momentum equation, we see several interesting consequences of the effect.
Turbulent cross helicity coupled with the mean magnetic shear reduces the
effect of turbulent or eddy viscosity. Flow induction is an important
consequence of this effect. One key issue in the cross-helicity dynamo is to
examine how and how much cross helicity can be present in turbulence. On the
basis of the cross-helicity transport equation, its production mechanisms are
discussed. Some recent developments in numerical validation of the basic notion
of the cross-helicity dynamo are also presented.

penalties for imbalances between the contracted power and the power that is

a co-located energy storage system, and can thus reshape its wind power
production subject to its storage capacity constraints. Modeling wind power as
a random process, we show that the problem of determining optimal forward
contract offerings--given recourse with storage--is convex. We further
establish that the maximum expected profit is concave and non-decreasing in the
energy storage capacity, which reveals that the greatest marginal benefit from
energy storage is derived from initial investment in small storage capacity. We
provide a characterization of the marginal value of small energy storage
capacity to the WPP. The formulae we derive shed light on the relationship
between the value of storage and certain statistical measures of variability in

"  Given the complexity and heterogeneity in Cloud computing scenarios, the
modeling approach has widely been employed to investigate and analyze the
energy consumption of Cloud applications, by abstracting real-world objects and
processes that are difficult to observe or understand directly. It is clear
that the abstraction sacrifices, and usually does not need, the complete
reflection of the reality to be modeled. Consequently, current energy
consumption models vary in terms of purposes, assumptions, application
characteristics and environmental conditions, with possible overlaps between
different research works. Therefore, it would be necessary and valuable to
reveal the state-of-the-art of the existing modeling efforts, so as to weave
different models together to facilitate comprehending and further investigating
application energy consumption in the Cloud domain. By systematically
selecting, assessing and synthesizing 76 relevant studies, we rationalized and
organized over 30 energy consumption models with unified notations. To help
investigate the existing models and facilitate future modeling work, we
deconstructed the runtime execution and deployment environment of Cloud
applications, and identified 18 environmental factors and 12 workload factors
that would be influential on the energy consumption. In particular, there are
complicated trade-offs and even debates when dealing with the combinational
impacts of multiple factors.

"  While isovalent doping of GaAs (e.g. by In) leads to a repulsion between the
solute atoms, two Cr, Mn, or Fe atoms in GaAs are found to have lower energy
than the well-separated pair, and hence attract each other. The strong bonding
interaction between levels with t2 symmetry on the transition metal (TM) atoms
results in these atoms exhibiting a strong tendency to cluster. Using
first-principles calculations, we show that this attraction is maximal for Cr,
Mn and Fe while it is minimal for V. The difference is attributed to the
symmetry of the highest occupied levels. While the intention is to find
possible choices of spintronic materials that show a reduced tendency to
cluster, one finds that the conditions that minimize clustering tendencies also
minimize the stabilization of the magnetic state.

"  We introduce 3D-SIS, a novel neural network architecture for 3D semantic
instance segmentation in commodity RGB-D scans. The core idea of our method is
to jointly learn from both geometric and color signal, thus enabling accurate
instance predictions. Rather than operate solely on 2D frames, we observe that
most computer vision applications have multi-view RGB-D input available, which
we leverage to construct an approach for 3D instance segmentation that
effectively fuses together these multi-modal inputs. Our network leverages
high-resolution RGB input by associating 2D images with the volumetric grid
based on the pose alignment of the 3D reconstruction. For each image, we first
extract 2D features for each pixel with a series of 2D convolutions; we then
backproject the resulting feature vector to the associated voxel in the 3D
grid. This combination of 2D and 3D feature learning allows significantly
higher accuracy object detection and instance segmentation than
state-of-the-art alternatives. We show results on both synthetic and real-world
public benchmarks, achieving an improvement in mAP of over 13 on real-world

"  In order to study the influence of the environment on the stellar population
of early-type galaxies we have analyzed the relations between the density of
the environment (lrho) and the residuals to the Mg2-sigma relation, R_a, and
between lrho and the residuals to the Fundamental Plane, R_f. Our sample of
galaxies covers the range of densities, between field galaxies and poor
clusters. We confirm the existence of a slight environmental bias on the mean
stellar population and we show that this effect is due to a small fraction of
galaxie s containing a younger stellar sub-population while the majority of
galaxies, in any environment, are equally old. The galaxies which are likely to
contain a young stellar sub-population (negative R_a and R_f) are
preferentially found in the less dense environment.
  This segregation of the stellar population may reflect the morphology-density
relation or may result from a higher rate of recent star formation activity in
sparse environments. Using the rotational support to assess the presence of a

morphological segregation to population segregation. It is not yet possible to
rule out that the morphology-density relation is at the origin of the

iron-based superconductor. Our high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy studies show two hole-like ($\alpha$ and $\beta$) and two
electron-like ($\eta$ and $\delta$) Fermi pockets around the Brillouin zone
center and corner, respectively, all of which exhibit moderate dispersion along
$k_z$. However, a third hole-like band ($\gamma$) is not observed, which is
expected around the zone center from band calculations and is common in
iron-based superconductors. Since this band has the highest renormalization
factor and is known to be the most vulnerable to defects, its absence in our
data is likely due to defect scattering --- and yet superconductivity can exist
without coherent quasiparticles in the $\gamma$ band. This may help resolve the
current controversy on the superconducting gap structure of FeS. Moreover, by
comparing the $\beta$ bandwidths of various iron chalcogenides, including FeS,
FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, FeSe, and FeSe$_{1-x}$ Te$_x$, we find that the $\beta$
bandwidth of FeS is the broadest. However, the band renormalization factor of
FeS is still quite large, when compared with the band calculations, which
indicates sizable electron correlations. This explains why the unconventional

we are interested in two kinds of approximate stationarity notions for

and near-approximate stationarity (NAS). For GAS, our scheme removes the
unrealistic subgradient selection oracle assumption in (Zhang et al., 2020,

Davis & Drusvyatskiy (2019) showed that $\rho$-weakly convex functions admit
finite-time computation, while Tian & So (2021) provided the matching
impossibility results of dimension-free finite-time complexity for first-order

"  The Stokes phenomenon is the apparent discontinuous change in the form of the
asymptotic expansion of a function across certain rays in the complex plane,
known as Stokes lines, as additional expansions, pre-factored by exponentially
small terms, appear in its representation. It was first observed by G. G.
Stokes while studying the asymptotic behaviour of the Airy function. R. B.
Dingle proposed a set of rules for locating Stokes lines and continuing
asymptotic expansions across them. Included among these rules is the ""final
main rule"" stating that half the discontinuity in form occurs on reaching the
Stokes line, and half on leaving it the other side. M. V. Berry demonstrated
that, if an asymptotic expansion is terminated just before its numerically
least term, the transition between two different asymptotic forms across a
Stokes line is effected smoothly and not discontinuously as in the conventional
interpretation of the Stokes phenomenon. On a Stokes line, in accordance with
Dingle's final main rule, Berry's law predicts a multiplier of $\frac{1}{2}$
for the emerging small exponentials. In this paper, we consider two closely
related asymptotic expansions in which the multipliers of exponentially small
contributions may no longer obey Dingle's rule: their values can differ from
$\frac{1}{2}$ on a Stokes line and can be non-zero only on the line itself.
This unusual behaviour of the multipliers is a result of a sequence of
higher-order Stokes phenomena. We show that these phenomena are rapid but
smooth transitions in the remainder terms of a series of optimally truncated
hyperasymptotic re-expansions. To this end, we verify a conjecture due to C. J.
Howls.

"  Retrieving relevant items that match users' queries from billion-scale corpus
forms the core of industrial e-commerce search systems, in which
embedding-based retrieval (EBR) methods are prevailing. These methods adopt a
two-tower framework to learn embedding vectors for query and item separately
and thus leverage efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search to
retrieve relevant items. However, existing EBR methods usually ignore
inconsistent user behaviors in industrial multi-stage search systems, resulting
in insufficient retrieval efficiency with a low commercial return. To tackle

the $N$ nonnegative coordinate axes in $\mathbb{R}^N$ and a linear
transformation thereof. This reveals the following asymptotic behavior. Each
time that queues begin to build starting from an empty system, one of them
becomes dominant in the sense that it contains nearly all the workload in the

radial part of the WBM, given as a reflected Brownian motion (RBM) on the

excursions.
  As a heavy traffic result it is nonstandard in three ways: (i) In the

an RBM. (ii) It does not constitute an invariance principle, in that the limit
law (specifically, the angular distribution) is not determined solely by the
first two moments of the data, and is sensitive even to tie breaking rules.
(iii) The proof method does not fully characterize the limit law (specifically,

oscillations after a flare erupts nearby one of the loop footpoints. Measured
oscillation periods lie between 4.2 min and 6.9 min wherein the displacement
amplitudes range from 0.17 Mm to 1.16 Mm. A motion-magnification technique is
employed to detect the pre-flare decay-less oscillations. These oscillations
have similar periods (between 3.7 min and 5.0 min) like the previous ones but
their amplitudes (0.04 Mm to 0.12 Mm) are found to be significantly smaller. No

neither changed the nature of these oscillations (decaying vs decay-less) nor
the oscillation periods. The only effect the flare has is to increase the

article, we describe two techniques proposed by recent works that take this
approach of processing in memory further by exploiting the underlying operation
of the main memory technology to perform more complex tasks. First, we describe
RowClone, a mechanism that exploits DRAM technology to perform bulk copy and
initialization operations completely inside main memory. We then describe a
complementary work that uses DRAM to perform bulk bitwise AND and OR operations
inside main memory. These two techniques significantly improve the performance
and energy efficiency of the respective operations.

"  In this paper, we address the scene segmentation task by capturing rich
contextual dependencies based on the selfattention mechanism. Unlike previous
works that capture contexts by multi-scale features fusion, we propose a Dual
Attention Networks (DANet) to adaptively integrate local features with their
global dependencies. Specifically, we append two types of attention modules on
top of traditional dilated FCN, which model the semantic interdependencies in
spatial and channel dimensions respectively. The position attention module
selectively aggregates the features at each position by a weighted sum of the
features at all positions. Similar features would be related to each other
regardless of their distances. Meanwhile, the channel attention module
selectively emphasizes interdependent channel maps by integrating associated
features among all channel maps. We sum the outputs of the two attention
modules to further improve feature representation which contributes to more
precise segmentation results. We achieve new state-of-the-art segmentation
performance on three challenging scene segmentation datasets, i.e., Cityscapes,
PASCAL Context and COCO Stuff dataset. In particular, a Mean IoU score of 81.5%
on Cityscapes test set is achieved without using coarse data. We make the code

"  Recent entity and relation extraction works focus on investigating how to
obtain a better span representation from the pre-trained encoder. However, a
major limitation of existing works is that they ignore the interrelation
between spans (pairs). In this work, we propose a novel span representation
approach, named Packed Levitated Markers (PL-Marker), to consider the
interrelation between the spans (pairs) by strategically packing the markers in
the encoder. In particular, we propose a neighborhood-oriented packing
strategy, which considers the neighbor spans integrally to better model the
entity boundary information. Furthermore, for those more complicated span pair
classification tasks, we design a subject-oriented packing strategy, which
packs each subject and all its objects to model the interrelation between the
same-subject span pairs. The experimental results show that, with the enhanced
marker feature, our model advances baselines on six NER benchmarks, and obtains
a 4.1%-4.3% strict relation F1 improvement with higher speed over previous
state-of-the-art models on ACE04 and ACE05.

"  We relate the second order structure function of a time series with the power
spectrum of the original variable, taking an assumption of statistical
stationarity. With this approach, we find that the structure function is
strongly influenced by the large scales. The large scale contribution and the
contribution range are respectively 79% and 1.4 decades for a Kolmogorov -5/3
power spectrum. We show numerically that a single scale influence range, over
smaller scales is about 2 decades. We argue that the structure function is not
a good method to extract the scaling exponents when the data possess large
energetic scales. An alternative methodology, the arbitrary order Hilbert
spectral analysis which may constrain this influence within 0.3 decade, is
proposed to characterize the {scaling} property directly in an
amplitude-frequency space. An analysis of passive scalar (temperature)
turbulence time series is presented to show the influence of large scale
structures in real turbulence, and the efficiency of the Hilbert-based
methodology. The corresponding scaling exponents $\zeta_{\theta}(q)$ provided
by the Hilbert-based approach indicate that the passive scalar turbulence field
may be less intermittent than what was previously believed.

"  When the agent's observations or interactions are delayed, classic
reinforcement learning tools usually fail. In this paper, we propose a simple
yet new and efficient solution to this problem. We assume that, in the
undelayed environment, an efficient policy is known or can be easily learned,
but the task may suffer from delays in practice and we thus want to take them
into account. We present a novel algorithm, Delayed Imitation with Dataset
Aggregation (DIDA), which builds upon imitation learning methods to learn how
to act in a delayed environment from undelayed demonstrations. We provide a
theoretical analysis of the approach that will guide the practical design of
DIDA. These results are also of general interest in the delayed reinforcement
learning literature by providing bounds on the performance between delayed and
undelayed tasks, under smoothness conditions. We show empirically that DIDA
obtains high performances with a remarkable sample efficiency on a variety of
tasks, including robotic locomotion, classic control, and trading.

"  We establish a formal connection between the particle-particle (pp) random
phase approximation (RPA) and the ladder channel of the coupled cluster doubles
(CCD) equations. The relationship between RPA and CCD is best understood within
a Bogoliubov quasiparticle (qp) RPA formalism. This work is a follow-up to our
previous formal proof on the connection between particle-hole (ph) RPA and
ring-CCD. Whereas RPA is a quasibosonic approximation, CC theory is a correct
bosonization in the sense that the wavefunction and Hilbert space are exactly
fermionic. Coupled cluster theory achieves this goal by interacting the ph
(ring) and pp (ladder) diagrams via a third channel that we here call
""crossed-ring"" whose presence allows for full fermionic antisymmetry.
Additionally, coupled cluster incorporates what we call ""mosaic"" terms which
can be absorbed into defining a new effective one-body Hamiltonian. The
inclusion of these mosaic terms seems to be quite important. The pp-RPA an d
qp-RPA equations are textbook material in nuclear structure physics but are
largely unknown in quantum chemistry, where particle number fluctuations and
Bogoliubov determinants are rarely used. We believe that the ideas and
connections discussed in this paper may help design improved ways of
incorporating RPA correlation into density functionals based on a CC
perspective.

"  This paper studies global existence, hydrodynamic limit, and large-time
behavior of weak solutions to a kinetic flocking model coupled to the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The model describes the motion of
particles immersed in a Navier-Stokes fluid interacting through local
alignment. We first prove the existence of weak solutions using energy and
$L^p$ estimates together with the velocity averaging lemma. We also rigorously
establish a hydrodynamic limit corresponding to strong noise and local
alignment. In this limit, the dynamics can be totally described by a coupled
compressible Euler - incompressible Navier-Stokes system. The proof is via
relative entropy techniques. Finally, we show a conditional result on the
large-time behavior of classical solutions. Specifically, if the mass-density
satisfies a uniform in time integrability estimate, then particles align with
the fluid velocity exponentially fast without any further assumption on the
viscosity of the fluid.

"  Asteroseismic parameters allow us to measure the basic stellar properties of
field giants observed far across the Galaxy. Most of such determinations are,
up to now, based on simple scaling relations involving the large frequency
separation, \Delta\nu, and the frequency of maximum power, \nu$_{max}$. In this
work, we implement \Delta\nu\ and the period spacing, {\Delta}P, computed along
detailed grids of stellar evolutionary tracks, into stellar isochrones and
hence in a Bayesian method of parameter estimation. Tests with synthetic data
reveal that masses and ages can be determined with typical precision of 5 and
19 per cent, respectively, provided precise seismic parameters are available.
Adding independent information on the stellar luminosity, these values can
decrease down to 3 and 10 per cent respectively. The application of these
methods to NGC 6819 giants produces a mean age in agreement with those derived
from isochrone fitting, and no evidence of systematic differences between RGB
and RC stars. The age dispersion of NGC 6819 stars, however, is larger than
expected, with at least part of the spread ascribable to stars that underwent

"  Doubles play an indispensable role in the movie industry. They take the place
of the actors in dangerous stunt scenes or scenes where the same actor plays
multiple characters. The double's face is later replaced with the actor's face
and expressions manually using expensive CGI technology, costing millions of
dollars and taking months to complete. An automated, inexpensive, and fast way
can be to use face-swapping techniques that aim to swap an identity from a
source face video (or an image) to a target face video. However, such methods
cannot preserve the source expressions of the actor important for the scene's
context. To tackle this challenge, we introduce video-to-video (V2V)
face-swapping, a novel task of face-swapping that can preserve (1) the identity
and expressions of the source (actor) face video and (2) the background and
pose of the target (double) video. We propose FaceOff, a V2V face-swapping
system that operates by learning a robust blending operation to merge two face
videos following the constraints above. It reduces the videos to a quantized
latent space and then blends them in the reduced space. FaceOff is trained in a
self-supervised manner and robustly tackles the non-trivial challenges of V2V
face-swapping. As shown in the experimental section, FaceOff significantly
outperforms alternate approaches qualitatively and quantitatively.

"  We model and study the genetic evolution and conservation of a population of
diploid hermaphroditic organisms, evolving continuously in time and subject to
resource competition. In the absence of mutations, the population follows a
3-type nonlinear birth-and-death process, in which birth rates are designed to
integrate Mendelian reproduction. We are interested in the long term genetic
behaviour of the population (adaptive dynamics), and in particular we compute
the fixation probability of a slightly non-neutral allele in the absence of
mutations, which involves finding the unique sub-polynomial solution of a
nonlinear 3-dimensional recurrence relationship. This equation is simplified to
a 1-order relationship which is proved to admit exactly one bounded solution.
Adding rare mutations and rescaling time, we study the successive mutation
fixations in the population, which are given by the jumps of a limiting Markov
process on the genotypes space. At this time scale, we prove that the fixation
rate of deleterious mutations increases with the number of already fixed
mutations, which creates a vicious circle called the extinction vortex.

"  We report on an investigation of the double-layer manganite series
(La(1-z)Pr(z))1.2Sr1.8Mn2O7 (0 <= z <= 1), carried out on single crystals by
means of both macroscopic magnetometry and local probes of magnetism (muSR,
55Mn NMR). Muons and NMR demonstrate an antiferromagnetically ordered ground
state at non-ferromagnetic compositions (z >= 0.6), while more moderate Pr
substitutions (0.2 <= z <= 0.4) induce a spin reorientation transition within
the ferromagnetic phase.
  A large magnetic susceptibility is detected at {Tc,TN} < T < 250K at all
compositions. From 55Mn NMR spectroscopy, such a response is unambiguously
assigned to the intergrowth of a ferromagnetic pseudocubic phase
(La(1-z)Pr(z))(1-x)Sr(x)MnO3, with an overall volume fraction estimated as
0.5-0.7% from magnetometry. Evidence is provided for the coupling of the
magnetic moments of these inclusions with the magnetic moments of the
surrounding (La(1-z)Pr(z))1.2Sr1.8Mn2O7 phase, as in the case of finely

"  Policy specification for personal user data is a hard problem, as it depends
on many factors that cannot be predetermined by system developers.
Simultaneously, systems are increasingly relying on users to make security

for specifying user-specific security policies. PyBE brings the benefits of the
successful approach of programming by example (PBE) for program synthesis to
the policy specification domain. In PyBE, users provide policy examples that
specify if actions should be allowed or denied in certain scenarios. PyBE then
predicts policy decisions for new scenarios. A key aspect of PyBE is its use of
active learning to enable users to correct potential errors in their policy
specification. To evaluate PyBE's effectiveness, we perform a feasibility study
with expert users. Our study demonstrates that PyBE correctly predicts policies
with 76% accuracy across all users, a significant improvement over naive
approaches. Finally, we investigate the causes of inaccurate predictions to
motivate directions for future research in this promising new domain.

"  We combine the latest spectrally stacked data of 21-cm emission from the
ALFALFA survey with an updated version of the Dark Sage semi-analytic model to
investigate the relative contributions of secular and environmental
astrophysical processes on shaping the HI fractions and quiescence of galaxies
in the local Universe. We calibrate the model to match the observed mean HI
fraction of all galaxies as a function of stellar mass. Without consideration
of stellar feedback, disc instabilities, and active galactic nuclei, we show
how the slope and normalisation of this relation would change significantly. We
find Dark Sage can reproduce the relative impact that halo mass is observed to
have on satellites' HI fractions and quiescent fraction. However, the model
satellites are systematically gas-poor. We discuss how this could be affected
by satellite--central cross-contamination from the group-finding algorithm
applied to the observed galaxies, but that it is not the full story. From our
results, we suggest the anti-correlation between satellites' HI fractions and
host halo mass, seen at fixed stellar mass and fixed specific star formation
rate, can be attributed almost entirely to ram-pressure stripping of cold gas.
Meanwhile, stripping of hot gas from around the satellites drives the
correlation of quiescent fraction with halo mass at fixed stellar mass. Further
detail in the modelling of galaxy discs' centres is required to solidify this
result, however. We contextualise our results with those from other
semi-analytic models and hydrodynamic simulations.

Halo Project, a survey that provides a complete, spectroscopically-identified

simulated star streams into the data and conclude that the high Galactic

absence of structure suggests there have been no major accretion events in the

different approaches with increasing complexity. The micromagnetic models,
where the string method is applied, are compared to the currently common

the in-pore population increases additional ions are located in less confined

keeping the topology constant comfort these observations. The interpretation of
properties across structures is more challenging. An interesting point is that
smaller pores do not necessarily lead to larger confinement. In this work, the
highest degrees of confinements are observed for intermediate pore sizes. We
also show a correlation between the quantity of adsorbed ions and the ratio

"  The radio signature of a shock travelling through the solar corona is known
as a type II solar radio burst. In rare cases these bursts can exhibit a fine

acceleration processes are unknown. Here, we use an image processing technique
known as the Hough transform to statistically analyse the herringbone fine
structure in a radio burst at $\sim$20-90 MHz observed from the Rosse
Solar-Terrestrial Observatory on 2011 September 22. We identify 188 individual
bursts which are signatures of bi-directional electron beams continuously
accelerated to speeds of 0.16$_{-0.10}^{+0.11} c$. This occurs at a shock
acceleration site initially at a constant altitude of $\sim$0.6 R$_{\odot}$ in
the corona, followed by a shift to $\sim$0.5 R$_{\odot}$. The anti-sunward
beams travel a distance of 170$_{-97}^{+174}$ Mm (and possibly further) away
from the acceleration site, while those travelling toward the sun come to a
stop sooner, reaching a smaller distance of 112$_{-76}^{+84}$ Mm. We show that
the stopping distance for the sunward beams may depend on the total number
density and the velocity of the beam. Our study concludes that a detailed
statistical analysis of herringbone fine structure can provide information on
the physical properties of the corona which lead to these relatively rare radio

"  A determinant formalism in combination with \emph{ab initio} calculations

including core-level excitonic effects, the Fermi-edge singularity, shakeup
excitations, and wavefunction overlap effects such as the orthogonality
catastrophe, all within a universal framework using many-electron
configurations. A heuristic search algorithm was introduced to search for the
configurations that are important for defining spectral lineshapes, instead of
enumerating them in a brute-force way. The algorithm has proven to be efficient
for calculating \ce{O} $K$ edges of transition metal oxides, which converge at
the second excitation order (denoted as $f^{(n)}$ with $n = 2$), i.e., the
final-state configurations with two \emph{e-h} pairs (with one hole being the

converge for general cases and at which excitation order $n$ one should stop
the determinant calculation. Even with the heuristic algorithm, the number of
many-electron configurations still grows exponentially with the excitation
order $n$. In this work, we prove two theorems that can indicate the order of
magnitude of the contribution of the $f^{(n)}$ configurations, so that one can
estimate their contribution very quickly without actually calculating their
amplitudes. The two theorems are based on the singular-value decomposition

two quantum many-body systems. We examine the $K$ edges of several metallic

cycles has a long-term variation with the period of about 20 activity cycles.
There is a positive correlation between the parameter Gn in the current cycle

less than the preceding even cycles, and it only proves the reversal of

regime for states with one or several counter-propagating neutral modes. We
consider a setup in which the neutral modes are heated by a hot spot, and where
heat transported by the neutral modes causes a temperature difference between
the upper and lower edges in a Hall bar. This temperature difference is probed
by the excess noise it causes for scattering across a quantum point contact. We
find that the excess noise in the quantum point contact provides evidence for
counter-propagating neutral modes, and we calculate its dependence on both the

and try to estimate the shape of the current solar cycle (Cycle 24) during its
maximum. We analyzed data for Solar Cycle 24 by using Learmonth Solar
Observatory sunspot group data since 2008. All sunspot groups (SGs) recorded
during this time interval were separated into two groups: The first group
includes small SGs [A, B, C, H, classes by the Zurich classification], and the
second group consists of large SGs [D, E, and F]. We then calculated small and
large sunspot group numbers, their sunspot numbers [SSN] and Zurich numbers
[Rz] from their daily mean numbers as observed on the solar disk during a given
month. We found that the temporal variations for these three different
separations behave similarly. We also analyzed the general shape of solar
cycles from Cycle 1 to 23 by using monthly International Sunspot Number [ISSN]
data and found that the durations of maxima were about 2.9 years. Finally, we
used ascending time and SSN relationship and found that the maximum of the
Cycle 24 should be later than 2011. Thus, we conclude that i) one possible
reason for a double maximum in solar cycles is the different behavior of large
and small sunspot groups, and ii) a double maximum is coming for Solar Cycle

"  The kinetics of a variety of transport-controlled processes can be reduced to
the problem of determining the mean time needed to arrive at a given location
for the first time, the so called mean first passage time (MFPT) problem. The
occurrence of occasional large jumps or intermittent patterns combining various
types of motion are known to outperform the standard random walk with respect
to the MFPT, by reducing oversampling of space. Here we show that a regular but
spatially heterogeneous random walk can significantly and universally enhance
the search in any spatial dimension. In a generic minimal model we consider a
spherically symmetric system comprising two concentric regions with piece-wise
constant diffusivity. The MFPT is analyzed under the constraint of conserved
average dynamics, that is, the spatially averaged diffusivity is kept constant.
Our analytical calculations and extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the
existence of an {\em optimal heterogeneity} minimizing the MFPT to the target.
We prove that the MFPT for a random walk is completely dominated by what we
term direct trajectories towards the target and reveal a remarkable
universality of the spatially heterogeneous search with respect to target size
and system dimensionality. In contrast to intermittent strategies, which are
most profitable in low spatial dimensions, the spatially inhomogeneous search
performs best in higher dimensions. Discussing our results alongside recent
experiments on single particle tracking in living cells we argue that the
observed spatial heterogeneity may be beneficial for cellular signaling
processes.

"  In order to develop predictive wear laws, relevant material parameters and
their influence on the wear rate need to be identified. Despite decades of
research, there is no agreement on the mathematical form of wear equations and
even the simplest models, such as Archard's, contain unpredictable fit
parameters. Here, we propose a simple model for adhesive wear in dry sliding
conditions that contains no fit parameters and is only based on material
properties and surface parameters. The model connects elastoplastic contact
solutions with the insight that volume detachment from sliding surfaces occurs
in the form of wear particles, the minimum size of which can be estimated. A
novelty of the model is the explicit tracking of the sliding process, which
allows us to meaningfully connect particle emission rates and sizes to the
macroscopic wear rate. The results are qualitatively promising, but we identify
the necessity for more controlled wear experiments and the parameters needed
from such work in order to fully verify and improve our model.

"  We analyze self-consistent N-body simulations of the Milky Way disk and the
ongoing disruption of the Sagittarius dwarf satellite to study the effect of
Sagittarius tidal debris on dark matter detection experiments. In agreement
with significant previous work, we reiterate that the standard halo model is
insufficient to describe the non-Maxwellian velocity distribution of the Milky
Way halo in our equilibrium halo-only and halo/galaxy models, and offer
suggestions for correcting for this discrepancy. More importantly, we emphasize
that the dark matter component of the leading tidal arm of the Sagittarius
dwarf is significantly more extended than the stellar component of the arm,
since the dark matter and stellar streams are not necessarily coaxial and may
be offset by several kpc at the point at which they impact the Galactic disk.
This suggests that the dark matter component of the Sagittarius debris is
likely to have a non-negligible influence on dark matter detection experiments
even when the stellar debris is centered several kpc from the solar
neighborhood. Relative to models without an infalling Sagittarius dwarf, the
Sagittarius dark matter debris in our models induces an energy-dependent
enhancement of direct search event rates of as much as ~20 - 45%, an
energy-dependent reduction in the amplitude of the annual modulation of the
event rate by as much as a factor of two, a shift in the phase of the annual
modulation by as much as ~20 days, and a shift in the recoil energy at which
the modulation reverses phase. These influences of Sagittarius are of general
interest in the interpretation of dark matter searches, but may be particularly
important in the case of relatively light (m_X < 20 GeV) dark matter because
the Sagittarius stream impacts the solar system at high speed compared to the
primary halo dark matter.

"  Bunch splitting is an RF manipulation method of changing the bunch structure,
bunch numbers and bunch intensity in the high-intensity synchrotrons that serve
as the injector for a particle collider. An efficient way to realize bunch
splitting is to use the combination of different harmonic RF systems, such as
the two-fold bunch splitting of a bunch with a combination of fundamental
harmonic and doubled harmonic RF systems. The two-fold bunch splitting and
three-fold bunch splitting methods have been experimentally verified and
successfully applied to the LHC/PS. In this paper, a generalized multi-fold

specially designed multi-harmonic RF systems was studied and tentatively
applied to the medium-stage synchrotron (MSS), the third accelerator of the

pileup effects and collective instabilities of a single bunch in the SPPC. The
results show that the five-fold bunch splitting is feasible and both the bunch
population distribution and longitudinal emittance growth after the splitting

"  Head detection and localization is a demanding task and a key element for
many computer vision applications, like video surveillance, Human Computer
Interaction and face analysis. The stunning amount of work done for detecting
faces on RGB images, together with the availability of huge face datasets,
allowed to setup very effective systems on that domain. However, due to
illumination issues, infrared or depth cameras may be required in real
applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for head detection on
depth images that exploits the classification ability of deep learning
approaches. In addition to reduce the dependency on the external illumination,
depth images implicitly embed useful information to deal with the scale of the
target objects. Two public datasets have been exploited: the first one, called
Pandora, is used to train a deep binary classifier with face and non-face
images. The second one, collected by Cornell University, is used to perform a
cross-dataset test during daily activities in unconstrained environments.
Experimental results show that the proposed method overcomes the performance of
state-of-art methods working on depth images.

Previously it has been studied what properties of $X$ does $W(X)$ inherit. For

effectively constructed from the description of $X$. We provide an explicit

"  In a recent paper [arXiv:1406.1320] Paris has made several comments
concerning the author's recent work on the exactification of Stirling's
approximation for the logarithm of the gamma function, $\ln \Gamma(z)$. Despite
acknowledging that the calculations in Ref. 2 are basically correct, he claims
that there is no need for the concept of regularisation when determining values
of $\ln \Gamma(z)$ from its complete asymptotic expansion. Here it is shown
that he has already applied the concept at the beginning of the analysis in
Ref. 1. Next he claims that the definition used in Ref. 2 for the Stokes
multiplier in the subdominant part of a complete expansion, which is
responsible for demonstrating that the Stokes phenomenon is discontinuous
rather than a smooth transition, is not correct. It is shown that the Stokes
multiplier used in Ref. 2 is entirely consistent with Berry's description of
the conventional view of the Stokes phenomenon in his famous work where he
developed the smoothing view [15]. Furthermore, it is pointed out that Paris
has not substantiated the smoothing view by at least reproducing or improving
the results in Table 7 of Ref. 2, which not only confirm the jump discontinuous
nature of the Stokes phenomenon, but also provide accurate values of $\ln
\Gamma(z)$ to 30 figures, regardless of the size of the variable or whether the
truncation is optimal or not. Finally, the issue of computational expediency of
MB-regularised values over Borel-summed values is discussed since Paris is
critical of the Borel-summed forms being used in computations.

with r_{1/2} approx0.2 pc. It dominates the nucleus at 3000 A, and is
consistent with late B-early A stars. This probable cluster may consist of
young stars and be an older version of the cluster of hot stars at the center
of the Milky Way, or it may consist of heavier stars built up from collisions
in a possible cold disk of stars orbiting P2. In M32, the central cusp rises
into the HST limit with gamma approx0.5, and the central density
rho_0>10^7M_sol pc^-3. The V-I and U-V color profiles are flat, and there is no
sign of an inner disk, dust, or any other structure. This total lack of
features seems at variance with a nominal stellar collision time of 2 X 10^10

sheds new light on the understanding of how local defects and their geometric

"  This paper considers two notions of effective dimension for quadrature in
weighted pre-Sobolev spaces with dominating mixed partial derivatives. We begin
by finding a ball in those spaces just barely large enough to contain a
function with unit variance. If no function in that ball has more than
$\varepsilon$ of its variance from ANOVA components involving interactions of
order $s$ or more, then the space has effective dimension at most $s$ in the
superposition sense. A similar truncation sense notion replaces the cardinality
of the ANOVA component by the largest index it contains. Some Poincar\'e type
inequalities are used to bound variance components by multiples of these
space's squared norm and those in turn provide bounds on effective dimension.
Very low effective dimension in the superposition sense holds for some spaces
defined by product weights in which quadrature is strongly tractable. The
superposition dimension is $O( \log(1/\varepsilon)/\log(\log(1/\varepsilon)))$
just like the superposition dimension used in the multidimensional
decomposition method. Surprisingly, even spaces where all subset weights are
equal, regardless of their cardinality or included indices, have low
superposition dimension in this sense. This paper does not require periodicity

with only three of the nuclei offset by more than 0.5"" from their galaxy
photocenter, and with the majority of nuclei having colors bluer than their
hosts. The nuclei are observed to be larger, and brighter, than typical Fornax
globular clusters, and to follow different structural scaling relations. A
comparison of our results to those from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey reveals
striking similarities in the properties of the nuclei belonging to these
different environments. We briefly review a variety of proposed formation
models and conclude that, for the low-mass galaxies in our sample, the most
important mechanism for nucleus growth is probably infall of star clusters
through dynamical friction, while for higher mass galaxies, gas accretion
triggered by mergers, accretions and tidal torques is likely to dominate, with
the relative importance of these two processes varying smoothly as a function
of galaxy mass. Some intermediate-mass galaxies in our sample show a complexity
in their inner structure that may be the signature of ""hybrid nuclei"" that
arose through parallel formation channels.

"  We discuss the effects of electric charging on the equilibrium configurations
of magnetized, rotating fluid tori around black holes of different mass. In the
context of gaseous/dusty tori in galactic nuclei, the central black hole
dominates the gravitational field and it remains electrically neutral, while
the surrounding material acquires some electric charge and exhibits
non-negligible self-gravitational effect on the torus structure. The structure
of the torus is influenced by the balance between the gravitational and
electromagnetic forces. A cusp may develop even in Newtonian tori due to the
charge distribution.

the base of the Born approxima-tion of quantum electrodynamics. The main
attention is paid to the question of the scattering cross section splitting

that both the coherent and the incoherent components of the scattering cross

"  We report the discovery of X-ray emission from NGC 7027, a prototypical
object for the study of the formation and evolution of planetary nebulae (PNs).
Observations with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) aboard the
Chandra X-ray Observatory show that the X-ray emission from NGC 7027 is
extended and is bipolar in morphology. The ACIS spectrum displays strong
emission from highly ionized Ne and weaker emission features which we attribute
to O, Mg, and Si. Model fits to this spectrum suggest a characteristic
temperature T_x ~ 3x10^6 K and an intrinsic (unabsorbed) X-ray luminosity of
L_x ~ 1.3x10^32 ergs/s. The intranebular absorption of X-ray emission is highly
nonuniform, but the modeling indicates an average column density N_H ~ 6x10^21
cm^-2, consistent with previous measurements of relatively large visual
extinction within the nebula. We suggest that the X-ray emission from NGC 7027
is or was generated by a hitherto undetected fast wind from the central star of
NGC 7027, or from a companion to this star. Chandra's detection of extended,
high-temperature X-ray emission from BD +30 3639, NGC 6543, and now NGC 7027
suggests that such emission is a common feature of young planetary nebulae.

"  Large-scale deep learning models contribute to significant performance
improvements on varieties of downstream tasks. Current data and model
parallelism approaches utilize model replication and partition techniques to
support the distributed training of ultra-large models. However, directly
deploying these systems often leads to sub-optimal training efficiency due to
the complex model architectures and the strict device memory constraints. In
this paper, we propose Optimal Sharded Data Parallel (OSDP), an automated
parallel training system that combines the advantages from both data and model
parallelism. Given the model description and the device information, OSDP makes
trade-offs between the memory consumption and the hardware utilization, thus
automatically generates the distributed computation graph and maximizes the
overall system throughput. In addition, OSDP introduces operator splitting to
further alleviate peak memory footprints during training with negligible
overheads, which enables the trainability of larger models as well as the
higher throughput. Extensive experimental results of OSDP on multiple different
kinds of large-scale models demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms
the state-of-the-art in multiple regards. Our code is available at

"  This paper reports on the derivation and implementation of a shape
optimization procedure for the minimization of hemolysis induction in
biomedical devices. Hemolysis is a blood damaging phenomenon that may occur in
mechanical blood-processing applications where large velocity gradients are
found. An increased level of damaged blood can lead to deterioration of the
immune system and quality of life. It is, thus, important to minimize
flow-induced hemolysis by improving the design of next-generation biomedical
machinery. Emphasis is given to the formulation of a continuous adjoint
complement to a power-law hemolysis prediction model dedicated to efficiently
identifying the shape sensitivity to hemolysis. The computational approach is
verified against the analytical solutions of a benchmark problem and computed
sensitivity derivatives are validated by a finite differences study on a
generic 2D stenosed geometry. The application included addresses a 3D ducted
geometry which features typical characteristics of biomedical devices. An
optimized shape, leading to a potential improvement in hemolysis induction up
to 22%, is identified. It is shown, that the improvement persists for

"  The dipole-dipole interaction between two Rydberg atoms depends on the
relative orientation of the atoms and on the change in the magnetic quantum
number. We simulate the effect of this anisotropy on the energy transport in an
amorphous many atom system subject to a homogeneous applied electric field. We
consider two experimentally feasible geometries and find that the effects
should be measurable in current generation imaging experiments. In both
geometries atoms of $p$ character are localized to a small region of space
which is immersed in a larger region that is filled with atoms of $s$
character. Energy transfer due to the dipole-dipole interaction can lead to a
spread of $p$ character into the region initially occupied by $s$ atoms. Over
long timescales the energy transport is confined to the volume near the border
of the $p$ region which is suggestive of Anderson localization. We calculate a
correlation length of 6.3~$\mu$m for one particular geometry.

"  We present a high resolution spectrum of the quasar, HS1603+3820
(z_em=2.542), observed with the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) on Subaru
Telescope. This quasar, first discovered in the Hamburg/CfA Quasar Survey, has
11 C IV lines at 1.96 < z_abs < 2.55. Our spectrum covers 8 of the 11 C IV
lines at z_abs > 2.29 and resolves some of them into multiple narrow components
with b < 25 km/s because of the high spectral resolution R=45000, while other
lines show broad profiles (b > 65 km/s). We use three properties of C IV lines,
specifically, time variability, covering factor, and absorption line profile,
to classify them into quasar intrinsic absorption lines (QIALs) and spatially
intervening absorption lines (SIALs). The C IV lines at 2.42 < z_abs < 2.45 are
classified as QIALs in spite of their large velocity shifts from the quasar.
Perhaps they are produced by gas clouds ejected from the quasar with the
velocity of v_ej = 8000 km/s -- 10000 km/s. On the other hand, three C IV lines
at 2.48 < z_abs < 2.55 are classified as SIALs, which suggests there exist
intervening absorbers near the quasar. We, however, cannot rule out QIALs for
the two lines at z_abs ~ 2.54 and 2.55, because their velocity shifts, 430 km/s
blueward and 950 km/s redward of the quasar, are very small. The C IV line at
z_abs ~ 2.48 consists of many narrow components, and has also corresponding
low-ionization metal lines (Al II, Si II, and Fe II). The velocity distribution
of these low-ionization ions is concentrated at the center of the system
compared to that of high-ionization C IV ion. Therefore we ascribe this system
of absorption lines to an intervening galaxy.

photometry for $\gamma$~Doradus. These data were obtained from several sites
during 1994 November as part of the MUSICOS-94 campaign. The star has two
closely-spaced periods of about 0.75 d and is the brightest member of a new
class of variable early F-type stars. A previously suspected third period, very
close to the other two, is confirmed. Previous observations indicated that
sudden changes could be expected in the spectrum, but none were found during
the campaign. The radial velocities rule out the possibility of a close
companion. The phasing between the radial velocity and light curve of the
strongest periodic component rules out the starspot model. The only viable
mechanism for understanding the variability is nonradial pulsation. We used the
method of moments to identify the modes of pulsation of the three periodic

harmonic degrees, ($\ell, m$), as follows: $f_1$ = (3,3), $f_2$ = (1,1) and

"  The replacement paths problem for directed graphs is to find for given nodes

For graphs with integer weights in {-M,...,M}, Weimann and Yuster recently

"  The temperature distribution of the cosmic gas-phase oxygen at z~3 is
determined by combining high resolution cosmological simulations with the

stellar IMFs, a Kroupa (K98), a Salpeter (S) and an Arimoto-Yoshii (AY),
spanning a range of a factor of five in chemical yield and specific SNII energy
feedback.
  Oxygen is found in all T phases (cold: logT<~4, warm: logT~4.5, hot:
logT>~5), in particular for the (top-heavy) AY IMF. For the K98 and S IMFs, the
most important phase is the cold one. Moreover, the cold phase alone contains
1-3 times the mass of oxygen in galactic stars for the three IMFs. The
implications of this in relation to DLA studies are discussed.
  In relation to ``missing metals'' it is found that a significant fraction of
the oxygen is located in a warm/hot phase that may be very difficult to detect.
Moreover, it is found that less than about 20-25% of the cosmic oxygen is
associated with galaxies brighter than M_V~-22, the faintest LBGs probed by
current metallicity determinations.
  From the LBG based, lambda~1500 AA luminosity density history at z>3, the

found that the (solar neighbourhood type) K98 IMF is strongly excluded (too
small yield), the S is marginally excluded, and the AY matches the constraint
well. The optimal IMF has a yield between the S and AY. A similar conclusion is
reached on the basis of the C IV abundance of the moderate density IGM.

already installed in the market. Furthermore, we model the captured utility by
means of an Ordered Median function (OMf) of the partial utilities of newly

Proxy performance tends to be worse during the warm season (May--October), when
most lightning occurs, and better during the cool season (November--April). The
correlation of annually accumulated CONUS CP with CG flash counts is not
statistically significant because of poor warm-season performance. Cool season
negative CG flash counts are well-correlated with CONUS CP values. Positive CG
flash counts ($\sim$7% of all CG flashes) are well correlated with annual
values of CONUS CP. The relatively strong relations between CP and CG flash

existence of exponential dichotomy for the evolution family generated by the
associated non autonomous homogeneous problem. We also prove a persistence

illustrate our result by consider a parabolic equation with non local and non

"  Globular Cluster (GC) formation seems to be a widespread mode of star
formation in extreme starbursts triggered by strong interactions and mergers of
massive gas-rich galaxies. We use our detailed chemically consistent
evolutionary synthesis models for spiral galaxies to predict stellar abundances
and abundance ratios of those second generation GCs as a function of their age
or formation redshift. Comparison with observed spectra of young star clusters
formed recently in an ongoing intercation (NGC 4038/39) and a merger remnant
(NGC 7252) are encouraging. Abundances and abundance ratios (and their
respective spreads) among young and intermediate cluster populations and among
the red peak GCs of elliptical/S0 galaxies with bimodal GC color distributions
are predicted to bear a large amount of information about those clusters'
formation processes and environment. Not only the bright young clusters but
also representative populations of ""old"" GCs in E/S0 galaxies are readily
accessible to MOS on 10m class telescopes.

"  In contrast to silicon-based transistors, single molecule junctions can be
gated by simple mechanical means. Specifically, charge can be transferred
between the junction's electrodes and its molecular bridge when the
interelectrode distance is modified, leading to variations in the electronic
transport properties of the junction. While this effect has been studied
extensively, the influence of the molecule orientation on mechanical gating has
not been addressed, despite its potential influence on the gating
effectiveness. Here, we show that the same molecular junction can experience
either clear mechanical gating or none, depending on the molecule orientation
in the junctions. The effect is found in silver-ferrocene-silver break
junctions, and analyzed in view of ab-initio and transport calculations, where
the influence of molecular orbitals geometry on charge transfer to or from the
molecule is revealed. The molecule orientation is thus a new degree of freedom
that can be used to optimize mechanically-gated molecular junctions.

also developed by exploiting computer simulations mostly in simple models.
Predictions based on these usually isotropic models are often at odds with
measurement results obtained for real materials. On the other hand, all-atom

strategy for effective molecular modelling, which properly reflects properties
of real particles by using quasi-real molecules of simple but anisotropic
architecture and identifying the applicable range of intermolecular
interactions for a given physical process or quantity. As a demonstration of
our method capabilities, we solve an intriguing problem within the density
scaling idea that has attracted attention in recent decades due to its
hallmarks of universality. It demonstrates that the new strategy for molecular
modelling opens broad perspectives for simulation and theoretical research, for
example, into unifying concepts in the glass transition physics.

"  The derivation of linear response theory within polarizable embedding is
carried out from a rigorous quantum-mechanical treatment of a composite system.
Two different subsystem decompositions (symmetric and nonsymmetric) of the
linear response function are presented, and the pole structures as well as
residues of the individual terms are analyzed and discussed. This theoretical
analysis clarifies which form of the response function to use in polarizable
embedding, and we highlight complications in separating out subsystem
contributions to molecular properties. For example, based on the nonsymmetric
decomposition of the complex linear response function, we derive conservation
laws for integrated absorption cross sections, providing a solid basis for
proper calculations of the intersubsystem intensity borrowing inherent to
coupled subsystems and how that can lead to negative subsystem intensities. We
finally identify steps and approximations required to achieve the transition
from a quantum-mechanical description of the composite system to polarizable
embedding with a classical treatment of the environment, thus providing a
thorough justification for the descriptions used in polarizable embedding
models.

"  Clustering has been widely applied to Information Retrieval (IR) on the
grounds of its potential improved effectiveness over inverted file search.
Clustering is a mostly unsupervised procedure and the majority of the
clustering algorithms depend on certain assumptions in order to define the
subgroups present in a data set .A clustering quality measure is a function
that, given a data set and its partition into clusters, returns a non-negative
real number representing the quality of that clustering. Moreover, they may
behave in a different way depending on the features of the data set and their
input parameters values. Therefore, in most applications the resulting
clustering scheme requires some sort of evaluation as regards its validity. The
quality of clustering can be enhanced by using a Cellular Automata Classifier
for information retrieval. In this study we take the view that if cellular
automata with clustering is applied to search results (query-specific
clustering), then it has the potential to increase the retrieval effectiveness
compared both to that of static clustering and of conventional inverted file
search. We conducted a number of experiments using ten document collections and
eight hierarchic clustering methods. Our results show that the effectiveness of
query-specific clustering with cellular automata is indeed higher and suggest
that there is scope for its application to IR.

"  We calculate the column density distribution of damped Lyman alpha systems,
modeled as spherical isothermal gaseous halos ionized by the external cosmic
background. The effects of self-shielding introduce a hump in this
distribution, at a column density N_{HI} \sim 1.6x10^{17} X^{-1} cm^{-2}, where
X is the neutral fraction at the radius where self-shielding starts being
important. The most recent compilation of the column density distribution by
Storrie-Lombardi & Wolfe shows marginal evidence for the detection of this
feature due to self-shielding, suggesting a value X \sim 10^{-3}. Assuming a
photoionization rate \Gamma \sim 10^{-12} s^{-1} from the external ionizing
background, the radius where self-shielding occurs is inferred to be about
3.8kpc. If damped Lyman alpha systems consist of a clumpy medium, this should
be interpreted as the typical size of the gas clumps in the region where they
become self-shielding. Clumps of this size with typical column densities N_H
\sim 3x10^{20} cm^{-2} would be in hydrostatic equilibrium at the
characteristic photoionization temperature \sim 10^4 K if they do not contain
dark matter. Since this size is similar to the overall radius of damped \lya
systems in Cold Dark Matter models, where all halos are assumed to contain
similar gas clouds producing damped absorbers, this suggests that the gas in
damped absorbers is in fact not highly clumped.

probes the contribution of the uppermost O atoms of the surface, associated

"  Nuclear relaxation is an important thermodynamic probe of electronic
excitations, in particular in conducting and superconducting systems. Here, an
empirical phenomenology based on all available literature data for planar Cu in
hole-doped cuprates is developed. It is found that most of the seemingly
different relaxation rates among the systems are due to a temperature
independent anisotropy that affects the mostly measured $1/T_{1\parallel}$, the
rate with an external magnetic field along the crystal $c$-axis, while
$1/T_{1\perp}$ is largely independent on doping and material above the critical
temperature of superconductivity ($T_c$). This includes very strongly overdoped
systems that show Fermi liquid behavior and obey the Korringa law. Below $T_c$
the relaxation rates are similar, as well, if plotted against the reduced
temperature $T/T_c$. Thus, planar Cu nuclear relaxation is governed by a
simple, dominant mechanism that couples the nuclei with varying anisotropy to a
rather ubiquitous bath of electronic excitations that appear Fermi liquid-like
irrespective of doping and family. In particular, there is no significant
enhancement of the relaxation due to electronic spin fluctuations, different
from earlier conclusions. Only the La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ family appears to be
an outlier as additional relaxation is present, however, the anisotropy remains
temperature independent. Also systems with very low doping levels, for which
there is a lack of data, may behave differently.

"  Aims: To measure the beryllium abundance in two TO stars of the Globular
Cluster NGC 6752, one oxygen rich and sodium poor, the other presumably oxygen
poor and sodium rich. Be abundances in these stars are used to put on firmer
grounds the hypothesis of Be as cosmochronometer and to investigate the
formation of Globular Clusters. Method:We present near UV spectra with
resolution R$\sim 45000$ obtained with the UVES spectrograph on the 8.2m VLT
Kueyen telescope, analysed with spectrum synthesis based on plane parallel LTE
model atmospheres. Results:Be is detected in the O rich star with
log(Be/H)=-12.04 $\pm$0.15, while Be is not detected in the other star for
which we obtain the upper limit log(Be/H)$<$-12.2. A large difference in
nitrogen abundance (1.6 dex) is found between the two stars. Conclusions:The Be
measurement is compatible with what found in field stars with the same [Fe/H]
and [O/H]. The 'Be age' of the cluster is found to be 13.3 Gyrs, in excellent
agreement with the results from main sequence fitting and stellar evolution.
The presence of Be confirms the results previously obtained for the cluster NGC
6397 and supports the hypothesis that Be can be used as a clock for the early
formation of the Galaxy. Since only an upper limit is found for the star with
low oxygen abundance, we cannot decide between competing scenarios of Globular
Cluster formation, but we can exclude that 'polluted' stars are substantially
younger than 'unpolluted' ones. We stress that the Be test might be the only
measurement capable of distinguishing between these scenarios.

"  The complex interaction between shocks and plasma turbulence is extremely
important to address crucial features of energy conversion in a broad range of
astrophysical systems. We study the interaction between a supercritical,
perpendicular shock and pre-existing, fully-developed plasma turbulence,
employing a novel combination of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and small-scale,
hybrid-kinetic simulations where a shock is propagating through a turbulent
medium. The variability of the shock front in the unperturbed case and for two
levels of upstream fluctuations is addressed.We find that the behaviour of
shock ripples, i.e., shock surface fluctuations with short (a few ion skin
depths, $d_i$) wavelengths, is modified by the presence of pre-existing
turbulence, which also induces strong corrugations of the shock front at larger
scales. We link this complex behaviour of the shock front and the shock
downstream structuring with the proton temperature anisotropies produced in the
shock-turbulence system. Finally, we put our modelling effort in the context of
spacecraft observations, elucidating the role of novel cross-scale,
multi-spacecraft measurements in resolving shock front irregularities at
different scales. These results are relevant for a broad range of astrophysical
systems characterised by the presence of shock waves interacting with plasma

"  We present the results of near-infrared (NIR) multi-epoch observations of the
optical transient in the nearby galaxy NGC300 (NGC300-OT) at 398 and 582 days
after the discovery with the Infrared Camera (IRC) onboard AKARI. NIR spectra
(2--5 um) of NGC300-OT were obtained for the first time. They show no prominent
emission nor absorption features, but are dominated by continuum thermal
emission from the dust around NGC300-OT. NIR images were taken in the 2.4, 3.2,
and 4.1 um bands. The spectral energy distributions (SED) of NGC300-OT indicate
the dust temperature of 810 (+-14) K at 398 days and 670 (+-12) K at 582 days.
We attribute the observed NIR emission to the thermal emission from dust grains
formed in the ejecta of NGC300-OT. The multi-epoch observations enable us to
estimate the dust optical depth as larger than about 12 at 398 days and larger
than about 6 at 582 days at 2.4 um, by assuming an isothermal dust cloud. The
observed NIR emission must be optically thick, unless the amount of dust grains
increases with time. Little extinction at visible wavelengths reported in
earlier observations suggests that the dust cloud around NGC300-OT should be
distributed inhomogeneously so as to not screen the radiation from the ejecta
gas and the central star. The present results suggest the dust grains are not
formed in spherically symmetric geometry, but rather in a torus, a bipolar
outflow, or clumpy cloudlets.

minimize the transmit power of users subject to guaranteeing an acceptable

difference of two convex functions (DC). Numerical results show that by dynamic
adjustment of the access and fronthaul delays, transmit power reduces in

of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and PD-NOMA are

inverted with those of molecular orbitals. We provide guidelines hunt for such
interstitial-electron-induced topological molecular crystals, especially in the
topological insulating state. They exhibit a variety of exceptional qualities,
as brought about by the intrinsic interplay of molecular crystals, interstitial

multiple orientations, with pronounced topological boundary states free from
dangling bonds. (2) Strong response to moderate mechanical perturbations,
whereby topological phase transition would occur under relatively low pressure.
(3) Inherent high-efficiency thermoelectricity as jointly contributed by the
non-parabolic band structure (therewith high thermopower), highly mobile
interstitial electrons (high electrical conductivity), and soft phonons (small
lattice thermal conductivity). (4) Ultralow work function owing to the active
interstitial electrons. We utilize first-principles calculations to demonstrate

two pulses left-hand polarised at 4.88 GHz, and one doubly-peaked (of opposite

from the dipolar symmetry of the stellar magnetic field topology, the model
described in this paper is also able to simulate the auroral radio emission

"  The interior composition of exoplanets is not observable, limiting our direct
knowledge of their structure, composition, and dynamics. Recently described
observational trends suggest that rocky exoplanets, that is, planets without

show that given this likely upper limit in the radii of purely-rocky

adiabatic temperature is relatively moderate, 630 GPa and 5000 K, while the
maximum central core pressure varies between 1.5 and 2.5 TPa. We further find
that for planets with radii less than 1.5 Earth radii, core-mantle boundary
pressure and adiabatic temperature are mostly a function of planet radius and
insensitive to planet structure. The pressures and temperatures of rocky
exoplanet interiors, then, are less than those explored in recent
shock-compression experiments, ab-initio calculations, and planetary dynamical
studies. We further show that the extrapolation of relevant equations of state
does not introduce significant uncertainties in the structural models of these
planets. Mass-radius models are more sensitive to bulk composition than any
uncertainty in the equation of state, even when extrapolated to TPa pressures.

"  In this work, we prove rigorous convergence properties for a semi-discrete,
moment-based approximation of a model kinetic equation in one dimension. This
approximation is equivalent to a standard spectral method in the velocity
variable of the kinetic distribution and, as such, is accompanied by standard
algebraic estimates of the form $N^{-q}$, where $N$ is the number of modes and
$q>0$ depends on the regularity of the solution. However, in the multiscale
setting, the error estimate can be expressed in terms of the scaling parameter
$\epsilon$, which measures the ratio of the mean-free-path to the
characteristic domain length. We show that, for isotropic initial conditions,
the error in the spectral approximation is $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{N+1})$. More
surprisingly, the coefficients of the expansion satisfy super convergence
properties. In particular, the error of the $\ell^{th}$ coefficient of the
expansion scales like $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{2N})$ when $\ell =0$ and
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{2N+2-\ell})$ for all $1\leq \ell \leq N$. This result is
significant, because the low-order coefficients correspond to physically
relevant quantities of the underlying system. All the above estimates involve
constants depending on $N$, the time $t$, and the initial condition. We
investigate specifically the dependence on $N$, in order to assess whether
increasing $N$ actually yields an additional factor of $\epsilon$ in the error.
Numerical tests will also be presented to support the theoretical results.

explain many properties of M31 and of its halo. The interaction and the fusion
may have begun 8.75+/-0.35 Gyr and 5.5 +/-0.5 Gyr ago, respectively. With an
almost quiescent star formation history before the fusion we retrieve fractions
of bulge, thin and thick disks as well as relative fractions of intermediate
age and old stars in both the thick disk and the Giant Stream. The Giant Stream
is caused by returning stars from a tidal tail previously stripped from the
satellite prior to the fusion. These returning stars are trapped into
elliptical orbits or loops for almost a Hubble time period. Large loops are
also predicted and they scale rather well with the recently discovered features
in the M31 outskirts. We demonstrate that a single merger could explain
first-order (intensity and size), morphological and kinematical properties of
the disk, thick disk, bulge and streams in the halo of M31, as well as the
distribution of stellar ages, and perhaps metallicities. It challenges
scenarios assuming one minor merger per feature in the disk (10 kpc ring) or at
the outskirts (numerous streams & thick disk). Further constraints will help to
properly evaluate the impact of such a major event to the Local Group.

gravitational lensing system SDSS\,J1011$+$0143. We use the high-resolution
\textsl{Hubble Space Telescope} (\textsl{HST}) F555W- and F814W-band imaging
and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopy of this system, which consists
of a close galaxy pair with a projected separation of $\approx 4.2$ kpc at
$z_{\rm lens} \sim 0.331$ lensing a Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) at $z_{\rm source}
= 2.701$. Comparisons between the mass peaks inferred from lens models and
light peaks from \textsl{HST} imaging data reveal significant spatial
mass/light offsets as large as $1.72 \pm 0.24 \pm 0.34$ kpc in both filter
bands. Such large mass/light offsets, not seen in isolated field lens galaxies
and relaxed galaxy groups, may be related to the interactions between the two
lens galaxies. The detected mass/light offsets can potentially serve as an
important test for the self-interacting dark matter model. However, other
mechanisms such as dynamical friction on spatially differently distributed dark
matter and stars could produce similar offsets. Detailed hydrodynamical
simulations of galaxy-galaxy interactions with self-interacting dark matter
could accurately quantify the effects of different mechanisms. The background
LAE is found to contain three distinct star-forming knots with characteristic
sizes from 116 pc to 438 pc. It highlights the power of strong gravitational
lensing in probing the otherwise too faint and unresolved structures of
distance objects below subkiloparsec or even 100 pc scales through its

"  The classical matrix tree theorem relates the number of spanning trees of a
connected graph with the product of the nonzero eigenvalues of its Laplacian
matrix. The class of regular matroids generalizes that of graphical matroids,
and a generalization of the matrix tree theorem holds for this wider class.
  We give a new, geometric proof of this fact by showing via a
dissect-and-rearrange argument that two combinatorially distinct zonotopes
associated to a regular matroid have the same volume. Along the way we prove
that for a regular oriented matroid represented by a unimodular matrix, the
lattice spanned by its cocircuits coincides with the lattice spanned by the

  Finally, by extending our setup to the weighted case we give new proofs of

"  We present the first simultaneous mapping of two-dimensional, time-dependent
velocity and pressure fields in a plane Couette flow pervaded by a transverse
magnetic field. While electromagnetic forces are strongest in fluids of high
electric conductivity such as liquid metals, their opacity excludes optical
optical measurement methods. We circumvent this difficulty using a transparent
electrolyte (Sulfuric acid), whose weaker conductivity is offset by higher
magnetic fields. We describe an experimental rig based on this idea, where the
Couette flow is entrained by a tape immersed in sulfuric acid and positioned
flush onto the bore of large superconducting magnet, so that most of the flow
is pervaded by a sufficiently homogeneous transverse magnetic field. Velocity
and pressure fields are obtained by means of a bespoke PIV system, capable of
recording the fluid's acceleration as well as its velocity. Both fields are
then fed into a finite difference solver that extracts the pressure field from
the magnetohydrodynamic governing equations. This method constitutes the first
implementation of the pressure PIV technique to an MHD flow. Thanks to it, we
obtain the first experimental velocity and pressure profiles in an MHD Couette

"  We study the non-linear evolution of baryon acoustic oscillations in the
matter power spectrum and correlation function from the improved perturbation
theory (PT). Based on the framework of renormalized PT, we apply the {\it
closure approximation} that truncates the infinite series of loop contributions
at one-loop order, and obtain a closed set of integral equations for power
spectrum and non-linear propagator. The resultant integral expressions keep
important non-perturbative properties which can dramatically improve the
prediction of non-linear power spectrum. Employing the Born approximation, we
then derive the analytic expressions for non-linear power spectrum and the
predictions are made for non-linear evolution of baryon acoustic oscillations
in power spectrum and correlation function. A detailed comparison between
improved PT results and N-body simulations shows that a percent-level agreement
is achieved in a certain range in power spectrum and in a rather wider range in
correlation function. Combining a model of non-linear redshift-space
distortion, we also evaluate the power spectrum and correlation function in
correlation function. In contrast to the results in real space, the agreement
between N-body simulations and improved PT predictions tends to be worse, and a
more elaborate modeling for redshift-space distortion needs to be developed.
Nevertheless, with currently existing model, we find that the prediction of
correlation function has a sufficient accuracy compared with the

initial cosmic matter density field constrained by peculiar velocity
observations. As our approach features a model for the gravitational evolution
of dark matter to connect the initial conditions to late-time observations, it
reconstructs the final density and velocity fields as natural byproducts. We
implement this field-based physical inference approach by adapting the Bayesian
Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm, which explores the
high-dimensional posterior through the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling.
We test the self-consistency of the method using random sets of mock tracers,
and assess its accuracy in a more complex scenario where peculiar velocity
tracers are non-linearly evolved mock haloes. We find that our framework
self-consistently infers the initial conditions, density and velocity fields,
and shows some robustness to model mis-specification. As compared to the
state-of-the-art approach of constrained Gaussian random fields/Wiener
filtering, our method produces more accurate final density and velocity field
reconstructions. It also allows us to constrain the initial conditions by
peculiar velocity observations, complementing in this aspect previous
field-based approaches based on other cosmological observables.

microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S), micro($\mu$)-laser angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. Our topographic STM images clearly reveal features corresponding
to point defects in the surface Te and subsurface Bi layers that we identify
with the aid of STM simulations as Bi$_\text{Te}$ antisites (Bi atoms at the Te
sites) and Mn$_\text{Bi}$ substitutions (Mn atoms at the Bi sites),
respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments further evidence the presence
of cation (Mn-Bi) intermixing. Altogether, this affects the distribution of the
Mn atoms, which, inevitably, leads to a deviation of the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$
magnetic structure from that predicted for the ideal crystal structure. Our
transport measurements suggest that the degree of this deviation varies from
sample to sample. Consistently, the ARPES/STS experiments reveal that the Dirac
point gap of the topological surface state is different for different
samples/sample cleavages. Our DFT surface electronic structure calculations
show that, due to the predominant localization of the topological surface state
near the Bi layers, Mn$_\text{Bi}$ defects can cause a strong reduction of the
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ Dirac point gap, given the recently proved antiparallel
alignment of the Mn$_\text{Bi}$ moments with respect to those of the Mn layer.

higher HCN-to-HCO+ J=3-2 flux ratios in localized off-nuclear regions than

mode-coupling field theories are necessary to reproduce the correct dynamical

and spin - has a prohibitive degree of intricacy. A simplifying path consists
in getting rid of density fluctuations by studying incompressible systems. This

that the constraint produces a new vertex that mixes static and dynamical

the renormalization group structure and the consistency of dynamics with
statics. Interestingly, although the solenoidal constraint leads to a
modification of the static universality class, we find that it does not change
the dynamical universality class, a result that seems to represent an exception
to the general rule that dynamical universality classes are narrower than
static ones. Our results constitute a solid stepping stone in the admittedly

"  Quasars are associated with and powered by the accretion of material onto
massive black holes; the detection of highly luminous quasars with redshifts
greater than z = 6 suggests that black holes of up to ten billion solar masses
already existed 13 billion years ago. Two possible present-day dormant
descendants of this population of active black holes have been found in the
galaxies NGC 3842 and NGC 4889 at the centres of the Leo and Coma galaxy
clusters, which together form the central region of the Great Wall - the
largest local structure of galaxies. The most luminous quasars, however, are
not confined to such high-density regions of the early Universe; yet dormant
black holes of this high mass have not yet been found outside of modern-day
rich clusters. Here we report observations of the stellar velocity distribution
in the galaxy NGC 1600 - a relatively isolated elliptical galaxy near the
centre of a galaxy group at a distance of 64 Mpc from Earth. We use orbit
superposition models to determine that the black hole at the centre of NGC 1600
has a mass of 17 billion solar masses. The spatial distribution of stars near
the centre of NGC 1600 is rather diffuse. We find that the region of depleted
stellar density in the cores of massive elliptical galaxies extends over the
same radius as the gravitational sphere of influence of the central black
holes, and interpret this as the dynamical imprint of the black holes.

"  With the widely used smart meters in the energy sector, anomaly detection
becomes a crucial mean to study the unusual consumption behaviors of customers,
and to discover unexpected events of using energy promptly. Detecting
consumption anomalies is, essentially, a real-time big data analytics problem,
which does data mining on a large amount of parallel data streams from smart

paper empirically evaluates the system and the detection algorithm, and the
results show the effectiveness and the scalability of the proposed lambda

"  Two-dimensional numerical simulations of an accretion flow in a close binary
system are performed by solving the Euler equations with radiative transfer. In
the present study, the specific heat ratio is assumed to be constant while
radiative cooling effect is included as a non-adiabatic process. The cooling
effect of the disc is considered by discharging energy in the vertical
directions from the top and bottom surfaces of the disc. We use the
flux-limited diffusion approximation to calculate the radiative heat flux
values. Our calculations show that a disc structure appears and the spiral
shocks are formed on the disc. These features are similar to that observed in
the case of an adiabatic gas with a lower specific heat ratio, $\gamma=1.01$.
It is found that when radiative cooling effect is accounted for, the mass of
the disc becomes larger than that assuming $\gamma=5/3$, and smaller than that
assuming $\gamma=1.01$. It is concluded that employing an adiabatic gas with a
lower specific heat ratio is almost a valid assumption for simulating accretion
disc with radiative cooling effect.

"  Vega, the second brightest star in the northern hemisphere, serves as a
primary spectral type standard. While its spectrum is dominated by broad
hydrogen lines, the narrower lines of the heavy elements suggested slow to
moderate rotation, giving confidence that the ground-based calibration of its
visibile spectrum could be safely extrapolated into the ultraviolet and
near-infrared (through atmosphere models), where it also serves as the primary
photometric calibrator. But there have been problems: the star is too bright
compared to its peers and it has unusually shaped absorption line profiles,
leading some to suggest that it is a distorted, rapidly rotating star seen
pole-on. Here we report optical interferometric observations of Vega which
detect the asymmetric brightness distribution of the bright, slightly offset
polar axis of a star rotating at 93% of breakup speed. In addition to
explaining the unusual brightness and line shape pecularities, this result
leads to the prediction of an excess of near-infrared emission compared to the
visible, in agreement with observations. The large temperature differences
predicted across its surface call into question composition determinations,
adding uncertainty to Vega's age and opening the possibility that its debris
disk could be substantially older than previously thought.

"  Rotation measure (RM) grids of extragalactic radio sources have been widely
used for studying cosmic magnetism. But their potential for exploring the
intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) in filaments of galaxies is unclear, since
other Faraday-rotation media such as the radio source itself, intervening
galaxies, and the interstellar medium of our Galaxy are all significant
contributors. We study statistical techniques for discriminating the Faraday
rotation of filaments from other sources of Faraday rotation in future
large-scale surveys of radio polarization. We consider a 30 degree times 30
degree field-of-view toward the south Galactic pole, while varying the number
of sources detected in both present and future observations. We select sources
located at high redshifts and toward which depolarization and optical
absorption systems are not observed, so as to reduce the RM contributions from
the sources and intervening galaxies. It is found that a high-pass filter can
satisfactorily reduce the RM contribution from the Galaxy, since the angular
scale of this component toward high Galactic latitudes would be much larger
than that expected for the IGMF. Present observations do not yet provide a
sufficient source density to be able to estimate the RM of filaments. However,
from the proposed approach with forthcoming surveys, we predict significant
residuals of RM that should be ascribable to filaments. The predicted structure
of the IGMF down to scales of 0.1 degree should be observable with data from
the SKA, if we achieve selections of sources toward which sight lines do not
contain intervening galaxies and RM errors are less than a few rad m-2.

inferred from recent ground based observations. By adjusting two free

"  Excitons play major roles in optical processes in modern semiconductors, such
as single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), transition metal dichalcogenides, and
2D perovskite quantum wells. They possess extremely large binding energies
(>100~meV), dominating absorption and emission spectra even at high
temperatures. The large binding energies imply that they are stable, that is,
hard to ionize, rendering them seemingly unsuited for optoelectronic devices
that require mobile charge carriers, especially terahertz emitters and solar
cells. Here, we have conducted terahertz emission and photocurrent studies on
films of aligned single-chirality semiconducting SWCNTs and find that excitons
autoionize, i.e., spontaneously dissociate into electrons and holes. This
process naturally occurs ultrafast (<1~ps) while conserving energy and
momentum. The created carriers can then be accelerated to emit a burst of
terahertz radiation when a dc bias is applied, with promising efficiency in
comparison to standard GaAs-based emitters. Furthermore, at high bias, the
accelerated carriers acquire high enough kinetic energy to create secondary
excitons through impact exciton generation, again in a fully energy and
momentum conserving fashion. This exciton multiplication process leads to a
nonlinear photocurrent increase as a function of bias. Our theoretical
simulations based on nonequilibrium Boltzmann transport equations, taking into
account all possible scattering pathways and a realistic band structure,
reproduce all our experimental data semi-quantitatively. These results not only
elucidate the momentum-dependent ultrafast dynamics of excitons and carriers in
SWCNTs but also suggest promising routes toward terahertz excitonics despite
the orders-of-magnitude mismatch between the exciton binding energies and the
terahertz photon energies.

"  The CMB is a powerful probe of early-universe physics but is only observed
after passing through large-scale structure, which changes the observed spectra
in important model-dependent ways. This is of particular concern given recent
claims of significant discrepancies with low redshift data sets when a standard
$\Lambda$CDM model is assumed. By using empirical measurements of the CMB
lensing reconstruction, combined with weak priors on the smoothness of the
lensing spectrum, foregrounds, and shape of any additional integrated
Sachs-Wolfe effect, we show how the early-universe parameters can be
constrained from CMB observations almost independently of the late-time
evolution. This provides a way to test new models for early-universe physics,
and measure early-universe parameters, independently of late-time cosmology.
Using the empirical measurement of lensing keeps the size of the effect of
late-time modelling uncertainty under control, leading to only modest increases
in error bars of most early-universe parameters compared to assuming a full
evolution model. We provide robust constraints on early-$\Lambda$CDM model
parameters using the latest Planck PR4 data and show that with future data
marginalizing over a single lensing amplitude parameter is sufficient to remove
sensitivity to late-time cosmological model only if the spectral shape matches

"  Our local environment at $r<10$ Mpc expands linearly and smoothly, as if
ruled by a uniform matter distribution, while observations show the very clumpy
local universe. This is a long standing enigma in cosmology. We argue that the
recently discovered vacuum or quintessence (dark energy (DE) component with the
equation of state $p_Q = w \rho_Q c^2$, $w \in [-1,0)$) from observations of
the high-redshift universe may also manifest itself in the properties of the
very local Hubble flow. We introduce the concept of the critical distance $r_Q$
where the repulsive force of dark energy starts to dominate over the gravity of
a mass concentration. For the Local Group $r_Q$ is about 1.5 Mpc. Intriguingly,
at the same distance 1.5 Mpc the linear and very ""cold"" Hubble flow emerges,
with about the global Hubble constant. We also consider the critical epoch
$t_Q$, when the DE antigravity began to dominate over the local matter gravity
for a galaxy which at the present epoch is in the local DE dominated region.
Our main result is that the homogeneous dark energy component, revealed by SNIa
observations, resolves the old confrontation between the local Hubble flow and
local highly non-uniform, fractal matter distribution. It explains why the
Hubble law starts on the outskirts of the Local Group, with the same Hubble
constant as globally and with a remarkably small velocity dispersion.

"  The turn-around radii of the galaxy groups show the imprint of a long battle
between their self-gravitational forces and the accelerating space. The
standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology based on the general relativity (GR) predicts
the existence of an upper bound on the expectation value of the turn-around
radius which is rarely violated by individual galaxy groups. We speculate that
a deviation of the gravitational law from GR on the cosmological scale could
cause an appreciable shift of the mean turn-around radius to higher values and
make the occurrence of the bound violation more probable. Analyzing the data
from high-resolution N-body simulations for two specific models with modified
gravity (MG) and the standard GR+$\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we determine the
turn-around radii of the massive Rockstar groups from the peculiar motions of
the galactic halos located in the bound zone where the fifth force generated by
MG is expected to be at most partially shielded. We detect a $4\sigma$ signal
of difference in the odds of the bound violations between a fiducial MG and the
GR models, proving that the odds of the bound violations increase with the
strength of the fifth force produced by the presence of MG. The advantage of
using the odds of the bound violations as a complementary diagnostics to probe
the nature of gravity is discussed.

low-chromospheric, vector magnetogram of a quiet-Sun patch or an active region
and performs calculations in the absence of three-dimensional magnetic and

Temporal correlations show more discrepancies that, however, are soundly

formation in the collapsing cloud cores is also followed. In the models
examined, the cloud core and parent cloud rotate rigidly and are initially
threaded by a uniform magnetic field. The simulations show that the cloud core
collapses along the magnetic field lines. The magnetic field in the dense
region of the cloud core rotates faster than that of the parent cloud as a
consequence of spin-up of the central region during the collapse. The cloud
core exhibits significant precession of the rotation axis, magnetic field, and
disk orientation, with precession highest in the models with low initial field

"  Top-$k$ classification is a generalization of multiclass classification used
widely in information retrieval, image classification, and other extreme
classification settings. Several hinge-like (piecewise-linear) surrogates have
been proposed for the problem, yet all are either non-convex or inconsistent.
For the proposed hinge-like surrogates that are convex (i.e., polyhedral), we
apply the recent embedding framework of Finocchiaro et al. (2019; 2022) to
determine the prediction problem for which the surrogate is consistent. These
problems can all be interpreted as variants of top-$k$ classification, which
may be better aligned with some applications. We leverage this analysis to
derive constraints on the conditional label distributions under which these
proposed surrogates become consistent for top-$k$. It has been further
suggested that every convex hinge-like surrogate must be inconsistent for
top-$k$. Yet, we use the same embedding framework to give the first consistent
polyhedral surrogate for this problem.

"  This study focuses on the Rijke tube problem, which includes features
relevant to the modeling of thermoacoustic coupling in reactive flows: a
compact acoustic source, an empirical model for the heat source, and
nonlinearities. This thermo-acoustic system features a complex dynamical
behavior. In order to synthesize accurate time-series, we tackle this problem
from a numerical point-of-view, and start by proposing a dedicated solver
designed for dealing with the underlying stiffness, in particular, the retarded
time and the discontinuity at the location of the heat source. Stability
analysis is performed on the limit of low-amplitude disturbances by means of
the projection method proposed by Jarlebring (2008), which alleviates the
linearization with respect to the retarded time. The results are then compared
to the analytical solution of the undamped system, and to Galerkin projection
methods commonly used in this setting. This analysis provides insight into the
consequences of the various assumptions and simplifications that justify the
use of Galerkin expansions based on the eigenmodes of the unheated resonator.
We illustrate that due to the presence of a discontinuity in the spatial
domain, the eigenmodes in the heated case, predicted by using Galerkin
expansion, show spurious oscillations resulting from the Gibbs phenomenon. By
comparing the modes of the linear to that of the nonlinear regime, we are able
to illustrate the mean-flow modulation and frequency switching. Finally,
time-series in the fully nonlinear regime, where a limit cycle is established,
are analyzed and dominant modes are extracted. The analysis of the saturated
limit cycles shows the presence of higher frequency modes, which are linearly
stable but become significant through nonlinear growth of the signal. This
bimodal effect is not captured when the coupling between different frequencies
is not accounted for.

"  We present a detailed stellar population analysis of 27 massive elliptical
galaxies within 4 very rich clusters at redshift z~0.2: A115, A655, A963 and
A2111. Using the new, high-resolution stellar populations models developed in
our group, we obtained accurate estimates of the mean luminosity-weighted ages
and relative abundances of CN, Mg and Fe. We have found that [CN/H] and [Mg/H]
are correlated with sigma while [Fe/H] and Log(age) are not. In addition, both
abundance ratios [CN/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] increase with sigma. Furthermore, the
[CN/H]-sigma and [CN/Fe]-sigma slopes are steeper for galaxies in very rich
clusters than those in the less dense Virgo and Coma clusters. On the other
hand, [Mg/H]-sigma and [Mg/Fe]-sigma slopes keep constant as functions of the
environment. Our results are compatible with a scenario in which the stellar
populations of massive elliptical galaxies, independently of their environment
and mass, had formation timescales shorter than ~1 Gyr. This result implies
that massive elliptical galaxies have evolved passively since, at least, as
long ago as z~2. For a given galaxy mass the duration of star formation is
shorter in those galaxies belonging to more dense environments; whereas the
mass-metallicity relation appears to be also a function of the cluster
properties: the denser the environment is, the steeper are the correlations.
Finally, we show that the abundance ratios [CN/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] are the key
""chemical clocks"" to infer the star formation history timescales in
ellipticals. In particular, [Mg/Fe] provides an upper limit for those formation
timescales, while [CN/Fe] apperars to be the most suitable parameter to resolve
them in elliptical galaxies with sigma<300 km/s.

"  Tactile sensing in soft robots remains particularly challenging because of
the coupling between contact and deformation information which the sensor is
subject to during actuation and interaction with the environment. This often
results in severe interference and makes disentangling tactile sensing and
geometric deformation difficult. To address this problem, this paper proposes a
soft capacitive e-skin with a sparse electrode distribution and deep learning
for information decoupling. Our approach successfully separates tactile sensing
from geometric deformation, enabling touch recognition on a soft pneumatic
actuator subject to both internal (actuation) and external (manual handling)
forces. Using a multi-layer perceptron, the proposed e-skin achieves 99.88\%
accuracy in touch recognition across a range of deformations. When complemented
with prior knowledge, a transformer-based architecture effectively tracks the
deformation of the soft actuator. The average distance error in positional
reconstruction of the manipulator is as low as 2.905$\pm$2.207 mm, even under
operative conditions with different inflation states and physical contacts
which lead to additional signal variations and consequently interfere with
deformation tracking. These findings represent a tangible way forward in the
development of e-skins that can endow soft robots with proprioception and
exteroception.

"  Using the WiFeS integral field spectrograph, we have undertaken a series of
observations of star-forming galaxies in Compact Groups. In this first paper
dedicated to the project, we present the analysis of the spiral galaxy NGC838,
a member of the Hickson Compact Group 16, and of its galactic wind. Our
observations reveal that the wind forms an asymmetric, bipolar, rotating
structure, powered by a nuclear starburst. Emission line ratio diagnostics
indicate that photoionization is the dominant excitation mechanism at the base
of the wind. Mixing from slow shocks (up to 20%) increases further out along
the outflow axis. The asymmetry of the wind is most likely caused by one of the
two lobes of the wind bubble bursting out of its HI envelope, as indicated by
line ratios and radial velocity maps. The characteristics of this galactic wind
suggest that it is caught early (a few Myr) in the wind evolution sequence. The
wind is also quite different to the galactic wind in the partner galaxy NGC839
which contains a symmetric, shock-excited wind. Assuming that both galaxies
have similar interaction histories, the two different winds must be a
consequence of the intrinsic properties of NGC838 and NGC839 and their
starbursts.

clusters are associates of liquid crystal spheres (LCS), each of which is
formed around a seed particle, a micro-crystal of sodium chloride. In this
paper, we show that the ingress of LCS in water from the surrounding air is
highly likely. When a certain threshold of the ionic strength of a solution is
exceeded (for example, in the process of evaporation of a portion of water),
the LCS begin to melt, passing into free water, and the salt crystals dissolve,
ensuring re-growth of larger crystals as a precipitate on the substrate. A
schematic diagram of the dynamics of phase transitions in water containing LCS
during evaporation is proposed.

"  In drying liquid films of polymer-colloid mixtures, the stratification in
which polymers are placed on top of larger colloids is studied. It is often
presumed that the formation of segregated polymer-colloid layers is solely due
to the proportion in size at fast evaporation as in binary colloid mixtures. By
comparing experiments with a theoretical model, we found that the transition in
viscosity near the drying interface was another important parameter for
controlling the formation of stratified layers in polymer-colloid mixtures. At
high evaporation rates, increased polymer concentrations near the surface lead
to a phase transition from semidilute to concentrated regime, in which
colloidal particles are kinetically arrested. Stratification only occurs if the
formation of a stratified layer precedes the evolution to the concentrated
regime near the drying interfaces. Otherwise, the colloids will be trapped by
the polymers in the concentrated regime before forming a segregated layer.
Also, no stratification is observed if the initial polymer concentration is too
low to form a sufficiently high polymer concentration gradient within a short
period of time. Our findings are relevant for developing solution-cast polymer
composite for painting, antifouling and antireflective coatings.

"  The first neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) merger was discovered on August
17, 2017 through gravitational waves (GW170817) and followed with
electromagnetic observations. This merger was detected in an old elliptical
galaxy with no recent star formation. We perform a suite of numerical
calculations to understand the formation mechanism of this merger. We probe
three leading formation mechanisms of double compact objects: classical
isolated binary star evolution, dynamical evolution in globular clusters and
nuclear cluster formation to test whether they are likely to produce NS-NS
mergers in old host galaxies. Our simulations with optimistic assumptions show
current NS-NS merger rates at the level of 10^-2 yr^-1 from binary stars, 5 x
10^-5 yr^-1 from globular clusters and 10^-5 yr^-1 from nuclear clusters for
all local elliptical galaxies (within 100 Mpc^3). These models are thus in
tension with the detection of GW170817 with an observed rate 1.5 yr^-1 (per 100
Mpc^3; LIGO/Virgo estimate). Our results imply that either (i) the detection of
GW170817 by LIGO/Virgo at their current sensitivity in an elliptical galaxy is
a statistical coincidence; or that (ii) physics in at least one of our three
models is incomplete in the context of the evolution of stars that can form
NS-NS mergers; or that (iii) another very efficient (unknown) formation channel
with a long delay time between star formation and merger is at play.

"  We study the critical behavior of Boolean variables on scale-free networks
with competing interactions (Ising spin glasses). Our analytical results for
the disorder-network-decay-exponent phase diagram are verified using Monte

finite-temperature spin-glass transition if the exponent that describes the
decay of the interaction degree in the scale-free graph is strictly larger than

stable for all temperatures. The robustness of both the ferromagnetic and

networks are quite stable to local perturbations. Finally, we show that for a
given decay exponent spin glasses on scale-free networks seem to obey
universality. Furthermore, when the decay exponent of the interaction degree is
larger than 4 in the spin-glass sector, the universality class is the same as
for the mean-field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Ising spin glass.

large physical and chemical network to describe the state of the nuclear ISM in
the evolving galaxies. Systematic changes are seen in the line ratios as the
sources evolve from early stage for the nuclear starburst (ULIRGs) to later
stages. These changes result from changing environmental conditions and
particularly from the lowering of the average density of the medium. A
temperature rise due to mechanical heating of the medium by feedback explains
the lowering of the ratios at later evolutionary stages. Infrared pumping may
affect the CN and HNC line ratios during early evolutionary stages. Molecular
transitions display a behavior that relates to changes of the environment
during an evolving nuclear starburst. Molecular properties may be used to

"  Similarity-preserving hashing is a commonly used method for nearest neighbour
search in large-scale image retrieval. For image retrieval, deep-networks-based
hashing methods are appealing since they can simultaneously learn effective
image representations and compact hash codes. This paper focuses on
deep-networks-based hashing for multi-label images, each of which may contain
objects of multiple categories. In most existing hashing methods, each image is
represented by one piece of hash code, which is referred to as semantic
hashing. This setting may be suboptimal for multi-label image retrieval. To
solve this problem, we propose a deep architecture that learns
\textbf{instance-aware} image representations for multi-label image data, which
are organized in multiple groups, with each group containing the features for
one category. The instance-aware representations not only bring advantages to
semantic hashing, but also can be used in category-aware hashing, in which an
image is represented by multiple pieces of hash codes and each piece of code
corresponds to a category. Extensive evaluations conducted on several benchmark
datasets demonstrate that, for both semantic hashing and category-aware
hashing, the proposed method shows substantial improvement over the
state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised hashing methods.

"  We have carried out high-resolution (~3') HI and CO line observations of
GW46.4+5.5 and analyzed available IR and radio emission survey data. GW46.4+5.5

the solar neighborhood. The high ratio is consistent with a hypothesis that the
dusts in the worms have been processed by interstellar shocks. The radio
continuum emission from the worm has a spectral index of -0.47 and does not
correlate with I_60. Thus, most of the radio continuum emission is likely to be
nonthermal. Our HI observations show that the HI gas is clumpy. We detected two
molecular clouds associated with the HI peaks. The molecular clouds do not
appear to be gravitationally bound. Using the Leiden-Dwingeloo HI data, we
identify an expanding HI supershell associated with GW46.4+5.5, which is a size
of 14^o*22^o. The supershell appears between 18 and 40 km/s, and decreases
slowly in size as the velocity increases. An averaged l-v diagram reveals that
the supershell has a central velocity of ~18 km/s (d_kin=1.4 kpc) and an
expansion velocity of ~15 km/s. The structure is also visible in adio continuum
maps. The observed molecular clouds might have condensed out of
shock-compressed gas in GW46.4+5.5 because they are closely associated with the
HI gas in velocity as well as in position. Their altitudes are 80 and 100 pc,
respectively, and their physical properties are very similar to those of the
high-altitude clouds. Our results suggest that at least some of the
high-altitude clouds might have formed in Galactic worms (or HI supershells).

the inter-class separability is the key to improving the accuracy. Motivated by
this, we propose a supervised contrastive learning based model to estimate
Genent's Grade of vertebral fracture with CT scans. The supervised contrastive
learning, as an auxiliary task, narrows the distance of features within the
same class while pushing others away, enhancing the model's capability of
capturing subtle features of vertebral fractures. Our method has a specificity
of 99% and a sensitivity of 85% in binary classification, and a macro-F1 of 77%

"  Let $\mathfrak g$ be a semisimple Lie algebra, $\vartheta\in {\sf
Aut}(\mathfrak g)$ a finite order automorphism, and $\mathfrak g_0$ the
subalgebra of fixed points of $\vartheta$. Recently, we noticed that using
$\vartheta$ one can construct a pencil of compatible Poisson brackets on
$\mathcal S(\mathfrak g)$, and thereby a `large' Poisson-commutative subalgebra
$\mathcal Z(\mathfrak g,\vartheta)$ of $\mathcal S(\mathfrak g)^{\mathfrak
g_0}$. In this article, we study invariant-theoretic properties of $(\mathfrak
g,\vartheta)$ that ensure good properties of $\mathcal Z(\mathfrak
g,\vartheta)$. Associated with $\vartheta$ one has a natural Lie algebra
contraction $\mathfrak g_{(0)}$ of $\mathfrak g$ and the notion of a good
generating system (=g.g.s.) in $\mathcal S(\mathfrak g)^\mathfrak g$. We prove
that in many cases the equality ${\mathsf{ind\,}}\mathfrak
g_{(0)}={\mathsf{ind\,}}\mathfrak g$ holds and $\mathcal S(\mathfrak

order automorphisms (1969), $\vartheta$ can be represented by a Kac diagram,
$\mathcal K(\vartheta)$, and our results often use this presentation. The most
surprising observation is that $\mathfrak g_{(0)}$ depends only on the set of
nodes in $\mathcal K(\vartheta)$ with nonzero labels, and that if $\vartheta$
is inner and a certain label is nonzero, then $\mathfrak g_{(0)}$ is isomorphic
to a parabolic contraction of $\mathfrak g$.

addresses the need for a new approach to HW sign-off verification which

this end, we introduce a formal definition of security with respect to
transient execution attacks, formulated as a HW property. We present a formal
proof methodology based on Unique Program Execution Checking (UPEC) which can
be used to systematically detect all vulnerabilities to transient execution
attacks in RTL designs. UPEC does not exploit any a priori knowledge on known
attacks and can therefore detect also vulnerabilities based on new, so far
unknown, types of channels. This is demonstrated by two new attack scenarios
discovered in our experiments with UPEC. UPEC scales to a wide range of HW
designs, including in-order processors (RocketChip), pipelines with
out-of-order writeback (Ariane), and processors with deep out-of-order
speculative execution (BOOM). To the best of our knowledge, UPEC is the first
RTL verification technique that exhaustively covers transient execution side

reanalysing lower resolution observations of the molecular gas around the black

velocity resolution and the depth of the galaxies potential have on the ability
to estimate black hole masses, and conclude by discussing prospects for the

circumstellar dust cloud through which the star is observed is partially
self-absorbing, which makes for complex computational modeling. We review
previous work and comment on the range of uncertainties about the physical
traits and mineralogical composition of the modeled disk. We show that these
uncertainties significantly affect the modeling of the outflow and the
estimated mass loss. In particular, we demonstrate that a variety of quite
diverse models can produce good fits to the observed spectrum. If the outflow
is steady, and the radiative repulsion on the dust cloud dominates the star's
gravitational attraction, we show that the total dust mass-loss rate is $\sim

"  We explore the possibility of the formation of globular clusters under
ultraviolet (UV) background radiation. One-dimensional spherical symmetric
radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations by Hasegawa et al. have demonstrated
that the collapse of low-mass (10^6-10^7 solar masses) gas clouds exposed to
intense UV radiation can lead to the formation of compact star clusters like
globular clusters (GCs) if gas clouds contract with supersonic infall
velocities. However, three-dimensional effects, such as the anisotropy of
background radiation and the inhomogeneity in gas clouds, have not been studied
so far. In this paper, we perform three-dimensional RHD simulations in a
semi-cosmological context, and reconsider the formation of compact star
clusters in strong UV radiation fields. As a result, we find that although
anisotropic radiation fields bring an elongated shadow of neutral gas, almost
spherical compact star clusters can be procreated from a ""supersonic infall""
cloud, since photo-dissociating radiation suppresses the formation of hydrogen
molecules in the shadowed regions and the regions are compressed by UV heated
ambient gas. The properties of resultant star clusters match those of GCs. On
the other hand, in weak UV radiation fields, dark matter-dominated star
clusters with low stellar density form due to the self-shielding effect as well
as the positive feedback by ionizing photons. Thus, we conclude that the
""supersonic infall"" under a strong UV background is a potential mechanism to
form GCs.

"  We investigate the relative importance of two galactic outflow suppression
mechanisms : a) Cosmological infall of the intergalactic gas onto the galaxy,
and b) the existence of a hot circumgalactic medium (CGM). Considering only
radial motion, the infall reduces the speed of outflowing gas and even halts
the outflow, depending on the mass and redshift of the galaxy. For star forming
galaxies there exists an upper mass limit beyond which outflows are suppressed
by the gravitational field of the galaxy. We find that infall can reduce this
upper mass limit approximately by a factor of two (independent of the
redshift). Massive galaxies ($\gtrsim 10^{12} M_{\odot}$) host large reservoir
of hot, diffuse CGM around the central part of the galaxy. The CGM acts as a
barrier between the infalling and outflowing gas and provides an additional
source of outflow suppression. We find that at low redshifts ($z\lesssim3.5$),
the CGM is more effective than the infall in suppressing the outflows.
Together, these two processes give a mass range in which galaxies are unable to
have effective outflows. We also discuss the impact of outflow suppression on
the enrichment history of the galaxy and its environment.

current-voltage characteristic curves in both inorganic

Furthermore, under this theoretical framework, the controversy of opposite TER
signs observed experimentally by different groups in

considering the interface termination effects using the effective contact

investigate the role of a CoO$_{x}$ buffer layer at the Co/BaTiO$_{3}$

significant memristor behavior, not only the interface oxygen vacancies but
also the CoO$_{x}$ layer thickness may vary with the applied bias.

"  We report results from HST/NICMOS 2 micron imaging polarimetry of the central
region of Centaurus A. In the vicinity of the nucleus we observe a complex
polarization structure which we explain by a combination of scattering of
nuclear light and dichroic polarization associated with the dust lane. The
scattered nuclear radiation is found in an angular region which extends over ~
70 degrees and thus it does not originate from a highly collimated beam, but is
associated with more omni-directional nuclear illumination. These observations
also show the presence of an unresolved, highly polarized (P = 11.1 %) nuclear
source whose polarization angle PA = 148.2 degrees is perpendicular to the jet
axis. We set an upper limit of 0.04'' (~0.8 pc) to its extent. The observed
nuclear polarization is naturally accounted for if we are observing scattered
light from an otherwise obscured nucleus provided that both the scattering
region and the occulting torus are extremely compact, with an outer radius of
less than ~ 1 pc. Alternatively, we might be directly seeing the infrared

"  The fate of surface water on Venus is one of the most important outstanding
problems in comparative planetology. Here a new concept is proposed to explain
water removal on a steam-covered proto Venus, referred to as impact-driven
planetary desiccation. Since a steam atmosphere is photochemically unstable,
water vapor dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen. Then, hydrogen escapes easily
into space through hydrodynamic escape driven by strong extreme ultraviolet
radiation from the young Sun. The focus is on the intense impact bombardment
during the terminal stage of planetary accretion as generators of a significant
amount of reducing agent. The fine-grained ejecta remove the residual oxygen,
the counter part of escaped hydrogen, via the oxidation of iron-bearing rocks
in a hot atmosphere. Thus, hypervelocity impacts cause net desiccation of the
planetary surface. I constructed a stochastic cratering model using a Monte
Carlo approach to investigate the cumulative mass of nonoxidized, ejected rocks
due to the intense impact bombardment. It is shown that a thick steam
atmosphere with a mass equivalent to that of the terrestrial oceans would be
removed. The cumulative mass of rocky ejecta released into the atmosphere
reaches 1 wt% of the host planet, which is 10000 times of the current mass of
the Earths atmosphere. These results strongly suggest that chemical reactions
between such large amounts of ejecta and planetary atmospheres are among the
key factors required to understand atmospheric mass and its composition, not
only in the Solar System but also in extrasolar systems.

calculation of the two transverse forces on the vortex, Magnus force and

the two orthogonal fundamental flexural modes of a high quality factor
nanostring resonator which are strongly coupled by a dielectric gradient field.
Full Bloch sphere control is demonstrated via Rabi, Ramsey and Hahn echo
experiments. This allows manipulating the classical superposition state of the
coupled modes in amplitude and phase and enables deep insight into the
decoherence mechanisms of nanomechanical systems. We have determined the energy
relaxation time T1 and phase relaxation times T2 and T2*, and find them all to
be equal. This not only indicates that energy relaxation is the dominating
source of decoherence, but also demonstrates that reversible dephasing
processes are negligible in such collective mechanical modes. We thus conclude
that not only T1 but also T2 can be increased by engineering larger mechanical
quality factors. After a series of ground-breaking experiments on ground state
cooling and non-classical signatures of nanomechanical resonators in recent
years, this is of particular interest in the context of quantum information
processing.

"  XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of the transient 7.8 s pulsar XTE
J1829-098 are used to characterize its pulse shape and spectrum, and to

absorbed, hard X-ray spectrum with Gamma = 0.76+/-0.13 and N_H = (6.0+/-0.6) x
10^{22} cm^{-2} is typical of X-ray binary pulsars. The precise Chandra

3x10^{32}(d/10 kpc)^2 ergs s^{-1}. We cannot rule out the possibility that the

the neutron star in an eccentric orbit. We also studied a late M-giant

"  Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) plays an important role in solving many
fundamental problems in video analysis in computer vision. Most MOT methods
employ two steps: Object Detection and Data Association. The first step detects
objects of interest in every frame of a video, and the second establishes
correspondence between the detected objects in different frames to obtain their
tracks. Object detection has made tremendous progress in the last few years due
to deep learning. However, data association for tracking still relies on hand
crafted constraints such as appearance, motion, spatial proximity, grouping
etc. to compute affinities between the objects in different frames. In this
paper, we harness the power of deep learning for data association in tracking
by jointly modelling object appearances and their affinities between different
frames in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed Deep Affinity Network (DAN)
learns compact; yet comprehensive features of pre-detected objects at several
levels of abstraction, and performs exhaustive pairing permutations of those
features in any two frames to infer object affinities. DAN also accounts for
multiple objects appearing and disappearing between video frames. We exploit
the resulting efficient affinity computations to associate objects in the
current frame deep into the previous frames for reliable on-line tracking. Our
technique is evaluated on popular multiple object tracking challenges MOT15,
MOT17 and UA-DETRAC. Comprehensive benchmarking under twelve evaluation metrics
demonstrates that our approach is among the best performing techniques on the
leader board for these challenges. The open source implementation of our work

"  Euclidean geometry is among the earliest forms of mathematical thinking.
While the geometric primitives underlying its constructions, such as perfect
lines and circles, do not often occur in the natural world, humans rarely
struggle to perceive and reason with them. Will computer vision models trained
on natural images show the same sensitivity to Euclidean geometry? Here we
explore these questions by studying few-shot generalization in the universe of
Euclidean geometry constructions. We introduce Geoclidean, a domain-specific
language for Euclidean geometry, and use it to generate two datasets of
geometric concept learning tasks for benchmarking generalization judgements of
humans and machines. We find that humans are indeed sensitive to Euclidean
geometry and generalize strongly from a few visual examples of a geometric
concept. In contrast, low-level and high-level visual features from standard
computer vision models pretrained on natural images do not support correct
generalization. Thus Geoclidean represents a novel few-shot generalization
benchmark for geometric concept learning, where the performance of humans and
of AI models diverge. The Geoclidean framework and dataset are publicly

"  The manifold theory of barred-spiral structure provides a dynamical mechanism
explaining how spiral arms beyond the ends of galactic bars can be supported by
chaotic flows extending beyond the bar's co-rotation zone. We discuss its
applicability to N-body simulations of secularly evolving barred galaxies. In
these simulations, we observe consecutive `incidents' of spiral activity,
leading to a time-varying disc morphology. Besides disc self-excitations, we
provide evidence of a newly noted excitation mechanism related to the
`off-centering' effect: particles ejected in elongated orbits at major
incidents cause the disc center-of-mass to recoil and be set in a wobble-type
orbit with respect to the halo center of mass. The time-dependent m=1
perturbation on the disc by the above mechanism correlates with the excitation
of new incidents of non-axisymmetric activity beyond the bar. At every new
excitation, the manifolds act as dynamical avenues attracting particles which
are directed far from corotation along chaotic orbits. The fact that the
manifolds evolve morphologically in time, due to varying non-axisymmetric
perturbations, allows to reconcile manifolds with the presence of multiple
patterns and frequencies in the disc. We find a time-oscillating pattern speed
profile $\Omega_p(R)$ at distances R between the bar's corotation, at resonance
with the succession of minima and maxima of the non-axisymmetric activity
beyond the bar. Finally, we discuss disc thermalization, i.e., the evolution of
the disc velocity dispersion profile and its connection with disc
responsiveness to manifold spirals.

"  Relativistic jets are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems that contain
compact objects. They transport large amounts of energy to large distances from
the source, and their interaction with the ambient medium has a crucial effect
on the evolution of the system. The propagation of the jet is characterized by
the formation of a shocked ""head"" at the front of the jet which dissipates the
jet's energy and a cocoon that surrounds the jet and potentially collimates it.
We present here a self consistent, analytic model that follows the evolution of
the jet and its cocoon, and describes their interaction. We show that the
critical parameter that determines the properties of the jet-cocoon system is
the dimensionless ratio between the jet's energy density and the rest-mass
energy density of the ambient medium. This parameter, together with the jet's
injection angle, also determines whether the jet is collimated by the cocoon or
not. The model is applicable to relativistic, unmagnetized, jets on all scales
and may be used to determine the conditions in AGNs jets as well as in GRBs or
microquasars. It shows that AGN and microquasar jets are hydrodynamically
collimated due to the interaction with the ambient medium, while GRB jets can
be collimated only inside a star and become uncollimated once they breakout.

"  Large eddy simulation (LES) of turbulence in complex geometries and domains
is often conducted with high aspect ratio resolution cells of varying shapes
and orientations. The effects of such anisotropic resolution are often
simplified or neglected in subgrid model formulation. Here, we examine
resolution induced anisotropy and demonstrate that, even for isotropic
turbulence, anisotropic resolution induces mild resolved Reynolds stress
anisotropy and significant anisotropy in second-order resolved velocity
gradient statistics. In large eddy simulations of homogeneous isotropic
turbulence with anisotropic resolution, it is shown that commonly used subgrid
models, including those that consider resolution anisotropy in their
formulation, perform poorly. The one exception is the anisotropic minimum
dissipation model proposed by Rozema et al. (Phys. of Fluids 27, 085107, 2015).
A simple new model is presented here that is formulated with an anisotropic
eddy diffusivity that depends explicitly on the anisotropy of the resolution.
It also performs well, and is remarkable because unlike other LES subgrid
models, the eddy diffusivity only depends on statistical characteristics of the
turbulence (in this case the dissipation rate), not on fluctuating quantities.
In other subgrid modeling formulations, such as the dynamic procedure, limiting
flow dependence to statistical quantities in this way could have advantages.

"  Despite their impressive capabilities, large pre-trained language models
(LMs) struggle with consistent reasoning; recently, prompting LMs to generate
explanations that self-guide the inference has emerged as a promising direction
to amend this. However, these approaches are fundamentally bounded by the
correctness of explanations, which themselves are often noisy and inconsistent.
In this work, we develop Maieutic Prompting, which infers a correct answer to a

Prompting induces a tree of explanations abductively (e.g. X is true, because
...) and recursively, then frames the inference as a satisfiability problem
over these explanations and their logical relations. We test Maieutic Prompting
for true/false QA on three challenging benchmarks that require complex
commonsense reasoning. Maieutic Prompting achieves up to 20% better accuracy
than state-of-the-art prompting methods, and as a fully unsupervised approach,
performs competitively with supervised models. We also show that Maieutic

"  Changing the vocal tract shape is one of the techniques which can be used by
the players of wind instruments to modify the quality of the sound. It has been
intensely studied in the case of reed instruments but has received only little
attention in the case of air-jet instruments. This paper presents a first study
focused on changes in the vocal tract shape in recorder playing techniques.
Measurements carried out with recorder players allow to identify techniques
involving changes of the mouth shape as well as consequences on the sound. A
second experiment performed in laboratory mimics the coupling with the vocal
tract on an artificial mouth. The phase of the transfer function between the
instrument and the mouth of the player is identified to be the relevant
parameter of the coupling. It is shown to have consequences on the spectral
content in terms of energy distribution among the even and odd harmonics, as
well as on the stability of the first two oscillating regimes. The results
gathered from the two experiments allow to develop a simplified model of sound
production including the effect of changing the vocal tract shape. It is based
on the modification of the jet instabilities due to the pulsating emerging jet.
Two kinds of instabilities, symmetric and anti-symmetric, with respect to the
stream axis, are controlled by the coupling with the vocal tract and the
acoustic oscillation within the pipe, respectively. The symmetry properties of
the flow are mapped on the temporal formulation of the source term, predicting
a change in the even / odd harmonics energy distribution. The predictions are
in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.

"  We model the plume ""splashback"" phase of the SL9 collisions with Jupiter

atmospheric model. A strong and complex shock structure results. The modeled
shock temperatures agree well with observations, and the structure and
evolution of the modeled shocks account for the appearance of high excitation
molecular line emission after the peak of the continuum light curve. The
splashback region cools by radial expansion as well as by radiation. The

"  Secondary contributions to the anisotropy of the Cosmic Microwave Background

Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZ), and the effect of gravitational lensing, have
distinctive non-Gaussian signatures, and full descriptions therefore require
information beyond that contained in their power spectra. In this paper we use
the recently introduced skew-spectra associated with the Minkowski Functionals
(MF) to probe the topology of CMB maps to probe the secondary non-Gaussianity
as a function of beam-smoothing in order to separate various contributions. We
devise estimators for these spectra in the presence of a realistic
observational masks and present expressions for their covariance as a function
of instrumental noise. Specific results are derived for the mixed ISW-lensing
and tSZ-lensing bispectra as well as contamination due to point sources for
noise levels that correspond to the Planck (143 GHz channel) and EPIC (150 GHz

find that these three spectra skew-spectra are correlated, having correlation
coefficients $r \sim 0.5-1.0$; higher $l$ modes are more strongly correlated.
Though the values of $S/N$ increase with decreasing noise, the triplets of

to reproduce the irregular Stokes profiles in the penumbra. I studied the
averaged and individual properties of the two components. By integrating the
field inclination to the surface, I developed a 3-D model of the spot from
inversion results without intrinsic height information. I find that the
Evershed flow is harbored by the weaker of the two field components. This
component forms flow channels that show upstreams in the inner and mid
penumbra, continue horizontally as slightly elevated loops throughout the
penumbra, and finally bend down in the outer penumbra. I find several examples,
where two or more flow channels are found along a radial cut from the umbra to
the outer boundary of the spot. I find that a model of horizontal flow channels
in a static background field is in good agreement with the observed spectra.
The properties of the flow channels correspond very well to the simulations of
Schlichenmaier et al. (1998). From the temporal evolution in intensity images
and the properties of the flow channels in the inversion, I conclude that
interchange convection of rising hot flux tubes in a thick penumbra still seems

for all field orientations), (2) the anisotropy of the upper critical field
over the full temperature range, (3) the correlation between superconductivity
and basal plane antiferromagnetism and (4) low-temperature power laws in the
transport and thermodynamic properties can be explained qualitatively, and in
many respects quantitatively, by an odd-parity, E$_{2u}$ order parameter with a
pair spin projection of zero along the ${\bf c}$-axis. The coupling of an AFM
moment to the superconducting order parameter acts as a symmetry breaking field
(SBF) which is responsible for the apparent tetracritical point, in addition to
the zero-field double transition. The results presented here for the E$_{2u}$
representation are based on an analysis of the material parameters calculated
within BCS theory for the 2D representations, and a refinement of the SBF model
of Hess, et al. [J. Phys. Condens. Matter, 1, 8135 (1989)]. I also discuss

"  In this paper, we consider the bandwidth-delay-hop constrained routing
problem in large-scaled software defined networks. A number of demands, each of
which specifies a source vertex and a sink vertex, are required to route in a
given network. We are asked to select a subset of demands, and assign a routing
path for each selected demand without violating the hop and delay constraints,
while assuring that the bandwidth occupied in each edge is not beyond its
capacity. The goal is to maximize the throughput (the total bandwidth) of the
selected demands. We develop an efficient heuristic algorithm for the problem,
which consists of three main steps, namely, computing feasible paths for each
demand, sorting the demands with some priority rules, selecting a path for each
demand. The algorithm is tested with networks of actual sizes and topologies,
generated by Huawei Technologies Company. The experiments show that the
proposed approach outperforms existing algorithms both in throughput and in
running time. In the experiments, our algorithm achieves more than 90\% of the
total bandwidth of the given demands within 10 seconds. Moreover, a large part
of our algorithm can run in parallel which largely speeds up the process when
using multi-core processors.

"  The Internet of Things needs for computing power and storage are expected to
remain on the rise in the next decade. Consequently, the amount of data

"  The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of epitaxial SrRuO$_3$ films with varying
lattice parameters is investigated, and analyzed according to the Berry-phase
scenario. SrRuO$_3$ thin films were deposited on SrTiO$_3$ substrates directly,

sign change of the Hall resistivity with the temperature, even for small
thicknesses of SrRuO$_3$. However, the anomalous Hall conductivity is greatly
reduced from its intrinsic value as the carrier scattering is increased when
the epitaxial strain is released. We argue that the AHE of fully strained

"  A survey of 28 stars using EUV spectra has been conducted to establish the
structure of stellar coronae in active binary systems from the EMD, electron
densities, and scale sizes. Observations obtained by the EUVE during 9 years of
operation are included for the stars in the sample. EUVE data allow a
continuous EMD to be constructed in the range log T~5.6-7.4, using iron
emission lines. These data are complemented with IUE observations to model the
lower temperature range. Inspection of the EMD shows an outstanding narrow
enhancement, or ``bump'' peaking around log T~6.9 in 25 of the stars, defining
a fundamental coronal structure. The emission measure per unit stellar area
decreases with increasing orbital (or photometric) periods of the target stars;
stars in binaries generally have more material at coronal temperatures than
slowly rotating single stars. High electron densities (Ne>10^12 cm^-3) are
derived at ~10 MK for some targets, implying small emitting volumes. The
observations suggest the magnetic stellar coronae of these stars are consistent
with two basic classes of magnetic loops: solar-like loops with maximum
temperature around log T~6.3 and lower electron densities (Ne>10^9-10.5), and
hotter loops peaking around log T~6.9 with higher electron densities
(Ne>10^12). For the most active stars, material exists at much higher

"  We consider magnetic field evolution of neutron stars during polar-cap

the resistivity. Outside the polar cap region, the temperature is such the
resistivity is dominated by temperature independent impurity scattering which
can be a few orders of magnitude larger than the electron- phonon resistivity.
The time-scale for field decay is therefore initially given by impurity
scattering dominated resistivity. When the field strength has been reduced to
$\sim 10^8 gauss$ the accretion is spherical and the time scale for field decay
is given by the smaller electron-phonon scattering resistivity. The field
strength is now reduced rapidly compared to before and this could be a reason
for there being no pulsars known with field strengths below $10^8 gauss$. We
also investigate the evolution of multipoles at the neutron star surface. We

curvature implies a transformation to Minkowski spacetime, which we call the
Connective transformation. Application of the Connective transformation
produces the usual effects of inertia when observed in Minkowski spacetime,
including hyperbolic motion in a static electric field (above the vacuum) and
uniform motion following an impulse. In the case of the electromagnetic vacuum
fields, the motion of the massless charge is a helical motion that can be
equated to the particle spin of quantum theory. This spin has the properties
expected from quantum theory, being undetermined until ""measured'' by applying
a field, and then being found in either a spin up or spin down state.
Furthermore, the zitterbewegung of the charge is at the speed of light, again
in agreement with quantum theory. Connectivity also allows for pair creation as
the Connective transformation can transform positive time intervals in the
particle spacetime to negative time intervals in Minkowski spacetime.

"  In the fast evacuation problem, we study the path planning problem for two
robots who want to minimize the worst-case evacuation time on the unit disk.
The robots are initially placed at the center of the disk. In order to
evacuate, they need to reach an unknown point, the exit, on the boundary of the
disk. Once one of the robots finds the exit, it will instantaneously notify the
other agent, who will make a beeline to it.
  The problem has been studied for robots with the same speed~\cite{s1}. We
study a more general case where one robot has speed $1$ and the other has speed
$s \geq 1$. We provide optimal evacuation strategies in the case that $s \geq
c_{2.75} \approx 2.75$ by showing matching upper and lower bounds on the
worst-case evacuation time. For $1\leq s < c_{2.75}$, we show (non-matching)
upper and lower bounds on the evacuation time with a ratio less than $1.22$.
Moreover, we demonstrate that a generalization of the two-robot search strategy
from~\cite{s1} is outperformed by our proposed strategies for any $s \geq
c_{1.71} \approx 1.71$.

"  This paper is a continuation of our recent paper devoted to refining the
parameters of three component (bulge, disk, halo) axisymmetric model Galactic
gravitational potentials differing by the expression for the dark matter halo
using the velocities of distant objects. In all models the bulge and disk
potentials are described by the Miyamoto-Nagai expressions. In our previous
paper we used the Allen-Santill'an (I), Wilkinson--Evans (II), and
Navarro-Frenk-White (III) models to describe the halo. In this paper we use a
spherical logarithmic Binney potential (model IV), a Plummer sphere (model V),
and a Hernquist potential (model VI) to describe the halo. A set of present-day
observational data in the range of Galactocentric distances R from 0 to 200 kpc
is used to refine the parameters of the listed models, which are employed most
commonly at present. The model rotation curves are fitted to the observed
velocities by taking into account the constraints on the local matter density
and the vertical force . Model VI looks best among the three models considered
here from the viewpoint of the achieved accuracy of fitting the model rotation
curves to the measurements. This model is close to the Navarro-Frenk-White
model III refined and considered best in our previous paper, which is shown
using the integration of the orbits of two globular clusters, Lynga 7 and NGC

that above 4 GeV the electron source spectrum is compatible with a power-law of

"  While the exact definition and implementation of accountability depend on the
specific context, at its core accountability describes a mechanism that will
make decisions transparent and often provides means to sanction ""bad""
decisions. As such, accountability is specifically relevant for Cyber-Physical
Systems, such as robots or drones, that embed themselves into a human society,
take decisions and might cause lasting harm. Without a notion of
accountability, such systems could behave with impunity and would not fit into
society. Despite its relevance, there is currently no agreement on its meaning
and, more importantly, no way to express accountability properties for these
systems. As a solution we propose to express the accountability properties of
systems using Structural Causal Models. They can be represented as
human-readable graphical models while also offering mathematical tools to
analyze and reason over them. Our central contribution is to show how
Structural Causal Models can be used to express and analyze the accountability
properties of systems and that this approach allows us to identify
accountability patterns. These accountability patterns can be catalogued and
used to improve systems and their architectures.

is found to be largely tail-less with no significant bridge emission. The
estimated life-time for the radiating electrons in the tail of the western lobe
appears smaller than the travel time of the radiating particles from the

jet at this location. The pressure of the intergalactic medium at $z\sim1$
estimated from the minimum energy density calculations appears to be marginally
lower than the value extrapolated from nearby giant radio galaxies.

"  Saliency maps that identify the most informative regions of an image for a
classifier are valuable for model interpretability. A common approach to
creating saliency maps involves generating input masks that mask out portions
of an image to maximally deteriorate classification performance, or mask in an
image to preserve classification performance. Many variants of this approach
have been proposed in the literature, such as counterfactual generation and
optimizing over a Gumbel-Softmax distribution. Using a general formulation of
masking-based saliency methods, we conduct an extensive evaluation study of a
number of recently proposed variants to understand which elements of these
methods meaningfully improve performance. Surprisingly, we find that a
well-tuned, relatively simple formulation of a masking-based saliency model
outperforms many more complex approaches. We find that the most important
ingredients for high quality saliency map generation are (1) using both
masked-in and masked-out objectives and (2) training the classifier alongside
the masking model. Strikingly, we show that a masking model can be trained with
as few as 10 examples per class and still generate saliency maps with only a
0.7-point increase in localization error.

users in visualizing and browsing social content, and also to help them in
organizing their own content. However, learning from social metadata presents

"  X-ray image plays an important role in manufacturing industry for quality
assurance, because it can reflect the internal condition of weld region.
However, the shape and scale of different defect types vary greatly, which
makes it challenging for model to detect weld defects. In this paper, we
propose a weld defect detection method based on convolution neural network,
namely Lighter and Faster YOLO (LF-YOLO). In particularly, a reinforced
multiscale feature (RMF) module is designed to implement both parameter-based
and parameter-free multi-scale information extracting operation. RMF enables
the extracted feature map capable to represent more plentiful information,
which is achieved by superior hierarchical fusion structure. To improve the
performance of detection network, we propose an efficient feature extraction
(EFE) module. EFE processes input data with extremely low consumption, and
improves the practicability of whole network in actual industry. Experimental
results show that our weld defect detection network achieves satisfactory
balance between performance and consumption, and reaches 92.9 mean average
precision mAP50 with 61.5 frames per second (FPS). To further prove the ability
of our method, we test it on public dataset MS COCO, and the results show that
our LF-YOLO has a outstanding versatility detection performance. The code is
available at https://github.com/lmomoy/LF-YOLO.

"  We present the first results of BeppoSAX observations of a small sample of
low brightness FRI radio galaxies. The flux of all the targets is consistent
with a thermal spectrum, as due to the presence of hot intracluster gas or
galactic corona. Moreover in three sources a non thermal absorbed spectrum can
be present in the MECS spectrum at energies larger than 7 keV, while for a
fourth object a high energy flux has been detected in the PDS instrument at
energies larger than 15 keV. This component could be related to the inner AGN
surrounded by an obscuring torus.

"  We analyze non-Gaussianity (NG) due to the primordial bispectrum and
trispectrum using CMB temperature maps of WMAP 7-year data. We first apply the
perturbative formulae of Minkowski functionals up to second-order NG derived by
Matsubara (2010), which enable us to give limits on cubic NG parametrized with
tau_NL and g_NL as well as various types of quadratic NG parametrized with
f_NL. We find no signature of primordial NG in WMAP 7-year data, but give
constraints on the local-type, equilateral-type, orthogonal-type f_NL:
f_NL(loc)=20+-42, f_NL(eq)=-121+-208, f_NL(ort)=-129+-171, respectively, and
tau_NL/10^4=-7.6+-8.7, and g_NL/10^5=-1.9+-6.4. We also find that these
constraints are consistent with the limits from skewness and kurtosis

"  In equilibrium, colloidal suspensions governed by short-range attractive and
long-range repulsive interactions form thermodynamically stable clusters. Using
Brownian dynamics computer simulations, we investigate how this equilibrium
clustering is affected when such particles are self-propelled. We find that the
clustering process is stable under self-propulsion. For the range of
interaction parameters studied and at low particle density, the cluster size
increases with the speed of self-propulsion (activity) and for higher activity
the cluster size decreases, showing a non-monotonic variation of cluster size
with activity. This clustering behaviour is distinct from the pure kinetic (or
motility-induced) clustering of self-propelling particles which is observed at
significantly higher activities and densities. We present an equilibrium model
incorporating the effect of activity as activity-induced attraction and
repulsion by imposing that the strength of these interactions depend on
activity superlinearly. The model explains the cluster size dependence of
activity obtained from simulations semi-quantitatively. Our predictions are

Casimir force for antiperiodic, Neumann, Dirichlet, and Neumann-Dirichlet mixed
b.c. in 1<d<4 dimensions. For the Casimir force, finite-size scaling is found
to be valid for all b.c.. For the free energy, finite-size scaling is valid in
1<d<3 and 3<d<4 dimensions for antiperiodic, Neumann, and Dirichlet b.c., but
logarithmic deviations from finite-size scaling exist in d=3 dimensions for
Neumann and Dirichlet b.c.. This is explained in terms of the borderline
dimension d*=3, where the critical exponent of the Gaussian surface energy
density vanishes. For Neumann-Dirichlet b.c., finite-size scaling is strongly
violated above T_c for 1<d<4. Our results include an exact description of the
dimensional crossover between the d-dimensional finite-size critical behavior
near bulk T_c and the (d-1)-dimensional critical behavior near T_c,film(L).
This dimensional crossover is illustrated for the critical behavior of the
specific heat. For 2<d<4, the Gaussian results are reformulated as one-loop
contributions of the phi^4 theory at fixed dimension and are compared with the
epsilon=4-d expansion results as well as with d=3 Monte Carlo data. For d=2,
the Gaussian results for the Casimir force scaling function are compared with
those for the Ising model; unexpected exact relations are found between the
Gaussian and Ising scaling functions. For both the Gaussian and the Ising model
it is shown that anisotropic couplings imply nonuniversal scaling functions of

this work the atomistic sp3d5s*-spin-orbit-coupled tight-binding model and the
linearized Boltzmann transport theory is applied to calculate the room

narrow 1D silicon nanowires (NWs). We present a comprehensive analysis of the

confinement on the power factor can be observed is at diameters below 7nm. We
show that contrary to the current view, the effect of confinement and geometry
on the power factor originates mostly from changes in the conductivity which is
strongly affected, rather than the Seebeck coefficient. In general, enhanced
scattering at these diameter scales strongly degrades the conductivity and
power factor of the device. We identify cases, however, for which confinement
largely improves the channel's conductivity, resulting in ~2-3X power factor
improvements. Our results may provide guidance in the design of efficient low

"  We investigate elastic wave propagation in finitely deformed dielectric
elastomers in the presence of an electrostatic field. To analyze the

compressible material models. We derive explicit expressions of the generalized
acoustic tensor and phase velocities of elastic waves for the ideal and
enriched dielectric elastomer models. We analyze the slowness curves of the
elastic wave propagation, and find the P-S-mode disentangling phenomenon. In
particular, P- and S- waves are separated by the application of an electric
field. The divergence angle between P- and S-waves strongly depends on the
applied electrostatic excitation. The influence of the electric field is
sensitive to material models. Thus, for ideal dielectric model the in-plane
shear velocity increases with an increase in electric field, while for the
enriched model the velocity may decreases depending on material constants.
Similarly, the divergence angle gradually increases with an increase in
electric field, while for the enriched model, the angle may be bounded.
Material compressibility affects the P-wave velocity, and, for relatively
compressible materials, the slowness curves evolve from circular to elliptical
shapes manifesting in an increase of the reflection angle of P-waves. As a

"  Optical pumping of solids creates a non-equilibrium electronic structure
where electrons and photons combine to form quasiparticles of dressed
electronic states. The resulting shift of electronic levels is known as the
optical Stark effect, visible as a red shift in the optical spectrum. Here we
show that in a pump-probe setup we can uniquely define a non-equilibrium
quasiparticle bandstructure that can be directly measurable with photo-electron
spectroscopy. The dynamical photon-dressing (and undressing) of the many-body
electronic states can be monitored by pump-probe time and angular resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) as the photon-dressed bandstructure
evolves in time depending on the pump-probe pulse overlap. The computed
tr-ARPES spectrum agrees perfectly with the quasi-energy spectrum of Floquet
theory at maximum overlap and goes to the the equilibrium bandstructure as the
pump-probe overlap goes to zero. Additionally, we show how this time-dependent
non-equilibrium quasiparticle structure can be understood to be the
bandstructure underlying the optical Stark effect. The extension to
spin-resolved PES can be used to predict asymmetric dichroic response linked to
the valley selective optical excitations in monolayer transition metal

"  The magnetic ground state of nanosized systems such as Fe double chains,
recently shown to form in the early stages of Fe deposition on Ir(100), is
generally nontrivial. Using ab initio density functional theory we find that
the straight ferromagnetic (FM) state typical of bulk Fe as well as of isolated
Fe chains and double chains is disfavored after deposition on Ir(100) for all
the experimentally relevant double chain structures considered. So long as
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is neglected, the double chain lowest energy state is
generally antiferromagnetic (AFM), a state which appears to prevail over the FM
state due to Fe-Ir hybridization. Successive inclusion of SOC adds two further
elements, namely a magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
(DM) spin-spin interaction, the former stabilizing the collinear AFM state, the
second favoring a long-period spin modulation. We find that anisotropy is most
important when the double chain is adsorbed on the partially deconstructed
Ir(100) -- a state which we find to be substantially lower in energy than any
reconstructed structure -- so that in this case the Fe double chain should
remain collinear AFM. Alternatively, when the same Fe double chain is adsorbed
in a metastable state onto the (5x1) fully reconstructed Ir(100) surface, the
FM-AFM energy difference is very much reduced and the DM interaction is
expected to prevail, probably yielding a helical spin structure.

"  Current Induced Resistance Switching (CIS) was recently observed in thin
tunnel junctions with ferromagnetic (FM) electrodes \emph{i.e} FM/I/FM. This
effect was attributed to electromigration of metallic atoms in
nanoconstrictions in the insulating barrier (I). Here we study how the CIS
effect is influenced by a thin non-magnetic (NM) Ta layer, deposited just below
the AlO$_x$ insulating barrier in tunnel junctions of the type FM/NM/I/FM
(FM=CoFe). Enhanced resistance switching occurs with increasing maximum applied
current ($\Imax$), until a plateau of constant CIS is reached for $\Imax\sim65$
mA (CIS$\sim$60%) and above. However, such high electrical currents also lead
to a large ($\sim$9%) irreversible resistance decrease, indicating barrier
degradation. Anomalous voltage-current characteristics with negative derivative
were also observed near $\pm\Imax$ and this effect is here attributed to
heating in the tunnel junction. One observes that the current direction for
which resistance switches in FM/NM/I/FM (clockwise) is opposite to that of
FM/I/FM tunnel junctions (anti-clockwise). This effect will be discussed in
terms of a competition between the electromigration contributions due to the so
called direct and wind forces. It will be shown that the direct force is likely
to dominate electromigration in the Ta (NM) layers, while the wind contribution

"  Active nematic fluids confined in narrow channels generate spontaneous flows

In this study we explore systematically active flows in this confined geometry

The Q-model allows for the presence of defects and biaxial, in addition to
uniaxial, molecular arrangements. Our aim is to provide a unified picture,
beyond the limiting regime explored previously, to serve as a guide for
potential microfluidic applications. We reveal how the nematic-flow coupling is
not only dependent on geometrical constraints but also highly sensitive to
material and flow parameters. We specifically stress the key role played by the
activity and the flow aligning parameter and we show that solutions depend on
two dimensionless parameters. We find that for large values of the activity
parameter the flow is suppressed for contractile particles while is either
sustained or suppressed for extensile particles depending on whether they tend
to align or tumble when subject to shear. We explain these distinct behaviors
by an argument based on the results of the stability analysis applied to
simpler configurations. We finally provide a numerical example of a biaxial
three-dimensional thresholdless active flow for which we show that biaxiality
is specially relevant for a weakly first-order isotropic-nematic phase
transition.

"  In stochastic thermodynamics, the entropy production of a thermodynamic
system is defined by the irreversibility measured by the logarithm of the ratio
of the path probabilities in the forward and reverse processes. We derive the
relation between the irreversibility and the entropy production starting from
the deterministic equations of motion of the whole system consisting of a
physical system and a surrounding thermal environment. The physical system is
driven by a nonconservative force. The derivation assumes the Markov
approximation that the environmental degrees of freedom equilibrate
instantaneously. Our approach concerns the irreversibility of the whole system
not only the irreversibility of the physical system only. This approach
provides a guideline for the choice of the proper reverse process to a given
forward process. We demonstrate our idea with an example of a charged particle
in the presence of a time-varying magnetic field.

"  While isovalent doping of GaAs (e.g. by In) leads to a repulsion between the
solute atoms, two Cr, Mn, or Fe atoms in GaAs are found to have lower energy
than the well-separated pair, and hence attract each other. The strong bonding
interaction between levels with t2 symmetry on the transition metal (TM) atoms
results in these atoms exhibiting a strong tendency to cluster. Using
first-principles calculations, we show that this attraction is maximal for Cr,
Mn and Fe while it is minimal for V. The difference is attributed to the
symmetry of the highest occupied levels. While the intention is to find
possible choices of spintronic materials that show a reduced tendency to
cluster, one finds that the conditions that minimize clustering tendencies also
minimize the stabilization of the magnetic state.

"  Here we report the electronic structure of FeS, a recently identified
iron-based superconductor. Our high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy studies show two hole-like ($\alpha$ and $\beta$) and two
electron-like ($\eta$ and $\delta$) Fermi pockets around the Brillouin zone
center and corner, respectively, all of which exhibit moderate dispersion along
$k_z$. However, a third hole-like band ($\gamma$) is not observed, which is
expected around the zone center from band calculations and is common in
iron-based superconductors. Since this band has the highest renormalization
factor and is known to be the most vulnerable to defects, its absence in our
data is likely due to defect scattering --- and yet superconductivity can exist
without coherent quasiparticles in the $\gamma$ band. This may help resolve the
current controversy on the superconducting gap structure of FeS. Moreover, by
comparing the $\beta$ bandwidths of various iron chalcogenides, including FeS,
FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, FeSe, and FeSe$_{1-x}$ Te$_x$, we find that the $\beta$
bandwidth of FeS is the broadest. However, the band renormalization factor of
FeS is still quite large, when compared with the band calculations, which
indicates sizable electron correlations. This explains why the unconventional
superconductivity can persist over such a broad range of isovalent substitution
in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$ and FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$.

"  We study the electronic relaxation in a quantum dot within the polaron
approach, by focusing on the {\it reversible} anharmonic decay of longitudinal
optical (LO) phonons forming the polaron into longitudinal acoustic (LA)
phonons. The coherent coupling between the LO and LA phonons is treated within
a mean-field approach. We derive a temperature-dependent inter-level coupling
parameter, related to the Gr\""uneisen parameter and the thermal expansion
coefficient, that characterizes an effective decay channel for the electronic
(or excitonic) states. Within this theory, we obtain a characteristic
anharmonic decay time of 1ns, 2-3 orders of magnitude longer than previous
predictions based on the Fermi's Golden Rule. We suggest that coherent
relaxation due to carrier-carrier interaction is an efficient alternative to
the (too slow) polaron decay.

we predict a peak in the Nernst coefficient with decreasing temperature below

temperature behaviour, which differs significantly from that of pure crystals.
The origin of these characteristic differences are tunneling centers formed by
atomic or molecular impurity ions. We have investigated the dielectric
susceptibility of hydroxyl ions in NaCl crystals at very low concentrations
(below 30 ppm), where interactions are believed to be negligible. We find that
the temperature dependence of the susceptibility is noticeably different from
what one would expect for isolated defects in a symmetric environment. We
propose that the origin of these deviations are random internal strains arising
from imperfections of the host crystal. We will present the experimental data

"  Magnetic skyrmion, i.e. a topologically stable swirling spin texture, appears
as a particle-like object in the two-dimensional (2D) systems, and has recently
attracted attention as a candidate of novel information carrier. In the real
three-dimensional (3D) systems, a skyrmion is expected to form a string
structure along an extra dimension, while its experimental identification has
rarely been achieved. Here, we report the direct visualization of 3D shape of
individual skyrmion strings, for the recently discovered room-temperature
skyrmion-hosting noncentrosymmetric compound Mn1.4Pt0.9Pd0.1Sn. For this

distribution based on the transmission images taken from various angles, a
genuine skyrmion string running through the entire thickness of the sample, as
well as various defect structures such as the interrupted and Y-shaped strings,
are successfully identified. The observed point defect may represent the
emergent magnetic monopole, as recently proposed theoretically. The present
tomographic approach with tunable magnetic field paves the way for the direct

"  Natural images are generated under many factors, including shape, pose,
illumination etc. Most existing ConvNets formulate object recognition from
natural images as a single task classification problem, and attempt to learn
features useful for object categories, but invariant to other factors of
variation as much as possible. These architectures do not explicitly learn
other factors, like pose and lighting, instead, they usually discard them by
pooling and normalization. In this work, we take the opposite approach: we
train ConvNets for object recognition by retaining other factors (pose in our
case) and learn them jointly with object category. We design a new multi-task
leaning (MTL) ConvNet, named disentangling CNN (disCNN), which explicitly
enforces the disentangled representations of object identity and pose, and is
trained to predict object categories and pose transformations. We show that
disCNN achieves significantly better object recognition accuracies than AlexNet
trained solely to predict object categories on the iLab-20M dataset, which is a
large scale turntable dataset with detailed object pose and lighting
information. We further show that the pretrained disCNN/AlexNet features on
iLab- 20M generalize to object recognition on both Washington RGB-D and
ImageNet datasets, and the pretrained disCNN features are significantly better
than the pretrained AlexNet features for fine-tuning object recognition on the
ImageNet dataset.

"  Many computational problems admit fast algorithms on special inputs, however,
the required properties might be quite restrictive. E.g., many graph problems
can be solved much faster on interval or cographs, or on graphs of small
modular-width or small tree-width, than on general graphs. One challenge is to
attain the greatest generality of such results, i.e., being applicable to less
restrictive input classes, without losing much in terms of running time.
  Building on the use of algebraic expressions we present a clean and robust
way of combining such homogeneous structure into more complex heterogeneous

tree-depth, and a natural notion of modular tree-depth. We give a generic
framework for designing efficient parameterized algorithms on the created graph

cases. To show the applicability we give efficient parameterized algorithms for
Negative Cycle Detection, Vertex-Weighted All-Pairs Shortest Paths, and

"  BEE is a compiler which facilitates solving finite domain constraints by
encoding them to CNF and applying an underlying SAT solver. In BEE constraints
are modeled as Boolean functions which propagate information about equalities
between Boolean literals. This information is then applied to simplify the CNF
encoding of the constraints. We term this process equi-propagation. A key
factor is that considering only a small fragment of a constraint model at one
time enables to apply stronger, and even complete reasoning to detect
equivalent literals in that fragment. Once detected, equivalences propagate to
simplify the entire constraint model and facilitate further reasoning on other
fragments. BEE is described in several recent papers. In this paper, after a
quick review of BEE, we elaborate on two undocumented details of the
implementation: the hybrid encoding of cardinality constraints and complete
equi-propagation. We thendescribe on-going work aimed to extend BEE to consider

"  We analyze some local properties of sparse Erdos-Renyi graphs, where $d(n)/n$
is the edge probability. In particular we study the behavior of very short

surely (a.a.s.~) bounded local treewidth and therefore is a.a.s.~nowhere dense.
We also discover a new and simpler proof that $G(n,d/n)$ has a.a.s.~bounded
expansion for constant~$d$. The local structure of sparse Erdos-Renyi Gaphs is
very special: The $r$-neighborhood of a vertex is a tree with some additional
edges, where the probability that there are $m$ additional edges decreases
with~$m$. This implies efficient algorithms for subgraph isomorphism, in
particular for finding subgraphs with small diameter. Finally we note that
experiments suggest that preferential attachment graphs might have similar
properties after deleting a small number of vertices.

"  Predicting an athlete's performance based on short footage is highly
challenging. Performance prediction requires high domain knowledge and enough
evidence to infer an appropriate quality assessment. Sports pundits can often

regressing an ultra-distance runner cumulative race time (CRT), i.e., the time
the runner has been in action since the race start, by using only a few seconds
of footage as input. We modified the I3D ConvNet backbone slightly and trained
a newly added regressor for that purpose. We use appropriate pre-processing of
the visual input to enable transfer learning from a specific runner. We show
that the resulting neural network can provide a remarkable performance for
short input footage: 18 minutes and a half mean absolute error in estimating
the CRT for runners who have been in action from 8 to 20 hours. Our methodology
has several favorable properties: it does not require a human expert to provide
any insight, it can be used at any moment during the race by just observing a
runner, and it can inform the race staff about a runner at any given time.

"  Memristors as emergent nano-electronic devices have been successfully
fabricated and used in non-conventional and neuromorphic computing systems in
the last years. Several behavioral or physical based models have been developed
to explain their operation and to optimize their fabrication parameters. All
existing memristor models are trade-offs between accuracy, universality and
realism, but, to the best of our knowledge, none of them is purely
characterized as quantum mechanical, despite the fact that quantum mechanical
processes are a major part of the memristor operation. In this paper, we employ
quantum mechanical methods to develop a complete and accurate filamentary model
for the resistance variation during memristor's operating cycle. More
specifically, we apply quantum walks to model and compute the motion of atoms
forming the filament, tight-binding Hamiltonians to capture the filament
structure and the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method to compute the
conductance of the device. Furthermore, we proceeded with the parallelization
of the overall model through Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate
our computations and enhance the model's performance adequately. Our simulation
results successfully reproduce the resistive switching characteristics of
memristors devices, match with existing fabricated devices experimental data,
prove the efficacy and robustness of the proposed model in terms of
multi-parameterization, and provide a new and useful insight into its

"  We consider the problem of finding a small hitting set in an {\it infinite}

consequence, we get an algorithm that finds, for any $\delta>0$, a set of size
$O(s_{\cF}(z^*_\cF))$ that hits $(1-\delta)$-fraction of $\cR$ (with respect to
a given measure) in time proportional to $\log(\frac{1}{\delta})$, where
$s_{\cF}(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ is the size of the smallest $\epsilon$-net the
range space admits, and $z^*_{\cF}$ is the value of the {\it fractional}
optimal solution. This {\it exponentially} improves upon previous results which
achieve the same approximation guarantees with running time proportional to
$\poly(\frac{1}{\delta})$. Our assumptions hold, for instance, in the case when
the range space represents the {\it visibility} regions of a polygon in
$\RR^2$, giving thus a deterministic polynomial time $O(\log
z^*_{\cF})$-approximation algorithm for guarding $(1-\delta)$-fraction of the
area of any given simple polygon, with running time proportional to

"  Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a simple non-invasive measure to identify

that future work in arrhythmia classification should follow the AAMI EC57

"  In this paper, we introduce online knapsack problems with a resource buffer.
In the problems, we are given a knapsack with capacity $1$, a buffer with

be taken into the buffer or discarded on its arrival irrevocably. When every
item has arrived, we transfer a subset of items in the current buffer into the

We consider four variants depending on whether items in the buffer are
removable (i.e., we can remove items in the buffer) or non-removable, and
proportional (i.e., the value of each item is proportional to its size) or
general. For the general&non-removable case, we observe that no constant
competitive algorithm exists for any $R\ge 1$. For the
proportional&non-removable case, we show that a simple greedy algorithm is

"  The problem of data augmentation in feature space is considered. A new
architecture, denoted the FeATure TransfEr Network (FATTEN), is proposed for
the modeling of feature trajectories induced by variations of object pose. This
architecture exploits a parametrization of the pose manifold in terms of pose
and appearance. This leads to a deep encoder/decoder network architecture,
where the encoder factors into an appearance and a pose predictor. Unlike
previous attempts at trajectory transfer, FATTEN can be efficiently trained
end-to-end, with no need to train separate feature transfer functions. This is
realized by supplying the decoder with information about a target pose and the
use of a multi-task loss that penalizes category- and pose-mismatches. In
result, FATTEN discourages discontinuous or non-smooth trajectories that fail
to capture the structure of the pose manifold, and generalizes well on object
recognition tasks involving large pose variation. Experimental results on the
artificial ModelNet database show that it can successfully learn to map source
features to target features of a desired pose, while preserving class identity.
Most notably, by using feature space transfer for data augmentation (w.r.t.
pose and depth) on SUN-RGBD objects, we demonstrate considerable performance
improvements on one/few-shot object recognition in a transfer learning setup,
compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

"  Graph embedding is a powerful method to represent graph neurological data
(e.g., brain connectomes) in a low dimensional space for brain connectivity
mapping, prediction and classification. However, existing embedding algorithms
have two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on preserving
one-to-one topological relationships between nodes (i.e., regions of interest
(ROIs) in a connectome), but they have mostly ignored many-to-many
relationships (i.e., set to set), which can be captured using a hyperconnectome
structure. Second, existing graph embedding techniques cannot be easily adapted
to multi-view graph data with heterogeneous distributions. In this paper, while
cross-pollinating adversarial deep learning with hypergraph theory, we aim to
jointly learn deep latent embeddings of subject0specific multi-view brain
graphs to eventually disentangle different brain states. First, we propose a
new simple strategy to build a hyperconnectome for each brain view based on
nearest neighbour algorithm to preserve the connectivities across pairs of
ROIs. Second, we design a hyperconnectome autoencoder (HCAE) framework which
operates directly on the multi-view hyperconnectomes based on hypergraph
convolutional layers to better capture the many-to-many relationships between
brain regions (i.e., nodes). For each subject, we further regularize the
hypergraph autoencoding by adversarial regularization to align the distribution
of the learned hyperconnectome embeddings with that of the input
hyperconnectomes. We formalize our hyperconnectome embedding within a geometric
deep learning framework to optimize for a given subject, thereby designing an
individual-based learning framework. Our experiments showed that the learned
embeddings by HCAE yield to better results for brain state classification

LaMB has a simple vision-based API that makes it more easily transferable to
real-world robot applications and scales to the large 3D environments. To
evaluate LaMB, we construct a set of tasks that illustrate the complex

Fine guidance using image similarity. The latter guidance helps avoid overly

"  Automatic airplane detection in aerial imagery has a variety of applications.
Two of the significant challenges in this task are variations in the scale and

generator symmetric line segments (SLS) that is developed based on the
symmetric and regular boundaries of airplanes from the top view. Then, the
generated proposals are used to train a deep convolutional neural network for
removing non-airplane proposals. Since each airplane can have multiple SLS
proposals, where some of them are not in the direction of the fuselage, we
collect all proposals corresponding to one ground-truth as a positive bag and
the others as the negative instances. To have multiple instance deep learning,
we modify the loss function of the network to learn from each positive bag at

non-maximum suppression to remove duplicate detections. Our experiments on NWPU

"  A major open problem in the area of infinite-duration games is to
characterize winning conditions that are determined in finite-memory
strategies. Infinite-duration games are usually studied over edge-colored
graphs, with winning conditions that are defined in terms of sequences of
colors. In this paper, we investigate a restricted class of finite-memory
strategies called chromatic finite-memory strategies. While general
finite-memory strategies operate with sequences of edges of a game graph,
chromatic finite-memory strategies observe only colors of these edges.
  Recent results in this area show that studying finite-memory determinacy is
more tractable when we restrict ourselves to chromatic strategies. On the other
hand, as was shown by Le Roux (CiE 2020), determinacy in general finite-memory
strategies implies determinacy in chromatic finite-memory strategies.
Unfortunately, this result is quite inefficient in terms of the state
complexity: to replace a winning strategy with few states of general memory, we
might need much more states of chromatic memory. The goal of the present paper
is to find out the exact state complexity of this transformation.
  For every winning condition and for every game graph with $n$ nodes we show
the following: if this game graph has a winning strategy with $q$ states of
general memory, then it also has a winning strategy with $(q + 1)^n$ states of
chromatic memory. We also show that this bound is almost tight. For every $q$
and $n$, we construct a winning condition and a game graph with $n + O(1)$
nodes, where one can win with $q$ states of general memory, but not with $q^n -
1$ states of chromatic memory.

"  The high energy consumption of proof of work-based distributed ledgers has
become an important environmental concern. Bitcoin, for example, consumes as
much energy in a year as a developed country. Alternative consensus mechanisms,

proof of work-based DLTs. For example, the IOTA DLT, built upon a directed
acyclic graph (DAG) architecture, uses an alternative consensus mechanism that
requires significantly less energy than other DLTs. Because the (DLT) space is
constantly and rapidly evolving, the question of how much energy DLTs actually
consume demands to be continuously studied and answered. Previous research into
the energy consumption of the IOTA network has shown that an optimization in
the overall protocol correlates to an optimization in energy consumption. The
planned IOTA 2.0 update, built upon the GoShimmer research prototype, promises
to further optimize the protocol by removing the network's centralized

previous research into the current mainnet, which is called Chrysalis. The main
findings of this report are that the IOTA 2.0 research prototype shows both
improvements and increase in the energy consumption metrics compared to the

total annual energy consumption of an IOTA network. This model should be
significant for future research as it enables a way to estimate the total cost
of running the IOTA network as well as its carbon emissions. Moreover, having
an annual power consumption metric allows for better objective comparisons to

"  The unit disk graph (UDG) is a widely employed model for the study of
wireless networks. In this model, wireless nodes are represented by points in
the plane and there is an edge between two points if and only if their
Euclidean distance is at most one. A hop spanner for the UDG is a spanning
subgraph $H$ such that for every edge $(p,q)$ in the UDG the topological
shortest path between $p$ and $q$ in $H$ has a constant number of edges. The
hop stretch factor of $H$ is the maximum number of edges of these paths. A hop
spanner is plane (i.e. embedded planar) if its edges do not cross each other.
  The problem of constructing hop spanners for the UDG has received
considerable attention in both computational geometry and wireless ad hoc
networks. Despite this attention, there has not been significant progress on
getting hop spanners that (i) are plane, and (ii) have low hop stretch factor.
Previous constructions either do not ensure the planarity or have high hop
stretch factor. The only construction that satisfies both conditions is due to
Catusse, Chepoi, and Vax\`{e}s (2010); their plane hop spanner has hop stretch
factor at most 449.
  Our main result is a simple algorithm that constructs a plane hop spanner for
the UDG. In addition to the simplicity, the hop stretch factor of the
constructed spanner is at most 341. Even though the algorithm itself is simple,
its analysis is rather involved. Several results on the plane geometry are
established in the course of the proof. These results are of independent
interest.

"  Background: Because of the difficulties involved in learning and using 3D
modeling and rendering software, many scientists hire programmers or animators
to create models and animations. This both slows the discovery process and
provides opportunities for miscommunication. Working with multiple
collaborators, we developed a set of design goals for a tool that would enable
them to directly construct models and animations. Results: We present
SketchBio, a tool that incorporates state-of-the-art bimanual interaction and
drop shadows to enable rapid construction of molecular structures and
animations. It includes three novel features: crystal by example, pose-mode
physics, and spring-based layout that accelerate operations common in the
formation of molecular models. We present design decisions and their
consequences, including cases where iterative design was required to produce
effective approaches. Conclusions: The design decisions, novel features, and
inclusion of state-of-the-art techniques enabled SketchBio to meet all of its
design goals. These features and decisions can be incorporated into existing
and new tools to improve their effectiveness

"  Compared to conventional general-purpose processors, accelerator-rich
architectures (ARAs) can provide orders-of-magnitude performance and energy
gains and are emerging as one of the most promising solutions in the age of
dark silicon. However, many design issues related to the complex interaction
between general-purpose cores, accelerators, customized on-chip interconnects,
and memory systems remain unclear and difficult to evaluate.
  In this paper we design and implement the ARAPrototyper to enable rapid
design space explorations for ARAs in real silicons and reduce the tedious
prototyping efforts far down to manageable efforts. First, ARAPrototyper
provides a reusable baseline prototype with a highly customizable memory
system, including interconnect between accelerators and buffers, interconnect
between buffers and last-level cache (LLC) or DRAM, coherency choice at LLC or
DRAM, and address translation support. Second, ARAPrototyper provides a clean
interface to quickly integrate users' own accelerators written in high-level
synthesis (HLS) code. The whole design flow is highly automated to generate a
prototype of ARA on an FPGA system-on-chip (SoC). Third, to quickly develop
applications that run seamlessly on the ARA prototype, ARAPrototyper provides a
system software stack, abstracts the accelerators as software libraries, and
provides APIs for software developers. Our experimental results demonstrate
that ARAPrototyper enables a wide range of design space explorations for ARAs
at manageable prototyping efforts, which has 4,000X to 10,000X faster
evaluation time than full-system simulations. We believe that ARAPrototyper can
be an attractive alternative for ARA design and evaluation.

"  Ubiquitous deployment of low-cost smart devices and widespread use of
high-speed wireless networks have led to the rapid development of the Internet
of Things (IoT). IoT embraces countless physical objects that have not been
involved in the traditional Internet and enables their interaction and
cooperation to provide a wide range of IoT applications. Many services in the
IoT may require a comprehensive understanding and analysis of data collected
through a large number of physical devices that challenges both personal
information privacy and the development of IoT. Information privacy in IoT is a
broad and complex concept as its understanding and perception differ among
individuals and its enforcement requires efforts from both legislation as well
as technologies. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art principles of
privacy laws, the architectures for IoT and the representative privacy
enhancing technologies (PETs). We analyze how legal principles can be supported
through a careful implementation of privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) at
various layers of a layered IoT architecture model to meet the privacy
requirements of the individuals interacting with IoT systems. We demonstrate
how privacy legislation maps to privacy principles which in turn drives the
design of necessary privacy enhancing technologies to be employed in the IoT

"  Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting with large language models has proven
effective in numerous natural language processing tasks, but designing prompts
that generalize well to diverse problem types can be challenging, especially in
the context of math word problem (MWP) solving. Additionally, it is common to
have a large amount of training data that have a better diversity coverage but
CoT annotations are not available, which limits the use of supervised learning
techniques. To address these issues, we investigate two approaches to leverage
the training data in a few-shot prompting scenario: dynamic program prompting
and program distillation. Our approach is largely inspired by Gao et al.,
(2022), where they proposed to replace the CoT with the programs as the
intermediate reasoning step. Such a prompting strategy allows us to accurately
verify the answer correctness through program execution in MWP solving. Our
dynamic program prompting involves annotating the training data by sampling
correct programs from a large language model, while program distillation
involves adapting a smaller model to the program-annotated training data. Our
experiments on three standard MWP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
these approaches, yielding significant improvements over previous baselines for
prompting and fine-tuning. Our results suggest that leveraging a large amount
of training data can improve the generalization ability of prompts and boost
the performance of fine-tuned small models in MWP solving.

more and more opportunities for concurrency within a computation. The

for improved throughput and reduced latency.
  We present a new coordination primitive for dataflow systems, the timestamp

Importantly, these projects did not need to design and implement whole systems

"  Scientific knowledge is constantly subject to a variety of changes due to new

The framework aims to accommodate a wide range of uncertain types, from
speculations to inconsistencies and controversies. We introduce a scalable and

different fields of research and accommodate individual analysts' unique

seed list of uncertainty cue words and how the validity of the expanded
candidate cue words are verified. We visualize the mixture of the original and
expanded uncertainty cue words to reveal the diversity of expressions of
uncertainty. These cue words offer a novel resource for the study of

there are two linear orders of its vertices such that the two endpoints of
every edge are consecutive in at least one of the two orders.

"  We present Face2Face, a novel approach for real-time facial reenactment of a
monocular target video sequence (e.g., Youtube video). The source sequence is
also a monocular video stream, captured live with a commodity webcam. Our goal
is to animate the facial expressions of the target video by a source actor and
re-render the manipulated output video in a photo-realistic fashion. To this
end, we first address the under-constrained problem of facial identity recovery
from monocular video by non-rigid model-based bundling. At run time, we track
facial expressions of both source and target video using a dense photometric
consistency measure. Reenactment is then achieved by fast and efficient
deformation transfer between source and target. The mouth interior that best
matches the re-targeted expression is retrieved from the target sequence and
warped to produce an accurate fit. Finally, we convincingly re-render the
synthesized target face on top of the corresponding video stream such that it
seamlessly blends with the real-world illumination. We demonstrate our method
in a live setup, where Youtube videos are reenacted in real time.

"  Medical image segmentation, the task of partitioning an image into meaningful
parts, is an important step toward automating medical image analysis and is at
the crux of a variety of medical imaging applications, such as computer aided
diagnosis, therapy planning and delivery, and computer aided interventions.
However, the existence of noise, low contrast and objects' complexity in
medical images are critical obstacles that stand in the way of achieving an
ideal segmentation system. Incorporating prior knowledge into image
segmentation algorithms has proven useful for obtaining more accurate and
plausible results. This paper surveys the different types of prior knowledge
that have been utilized in different segmentation frameworks. We focus our
survey on optimization-based methods that incorporate prior information into
their frameworks. We review and compare these methods in terms of the types of
prior employed, the domain of formulation (continuous vs. discrete), and the
optimization techniques (global vs. local). We also created an interactive
online database of existing works and categorized them based on the type of
prior knowledge they use. Our website is interactive so that researchers can
contribute to keep the database up to date. We conclude the survey by
discussing different aspects of designing an energy functional for image
segmentation, open problems, and future perspectives.

"  Software contracts allow programmers to state rich program properties using
the full expressive power of an object language. However, since they are
enforced at runtime, monitoring contracts imposes significant overhead and
delays error discovery. So contract verification aims to guarantee all or most
of these properties ahead of time, enabling valuable optimizations and yielding
a more general assurance of correctness. Existing methods for static contract
verification satisfy the needs of more restricted target languages, but fail to
address the challenges unique to those conjoining untyped, dynamic programming,
higher-order functions, modularity, and statefulness. Our approach tackles all
these features at once, in the context of the full Racket system---a mature
environment for stateful, higher-order, multi-paradigm programming with or
without types. Evaluating our method using a set of both pure and stateful
benchmarks, we are able to verify 99.94% of checks statically (all but 28 of
49, 861).
  Stateful, higher-order functions pose significant challenges for static
contract verification in particular. In the presence of these features, a
modular analysis must permit code from the current module to escape permanently
to an opaque context (unspecified code from outside the current module) that
may be stateful and therefore store a reference to the escaped closure. Also,
contracts themselves, being predicates wri en in unrestricted Racket, may
exhibit stateful behavior; a sound approach must be robust to contracts which
are arbitrarily expressive and interwoven with the code they monitor. In this
paper, we present and evaluate our solution based on higher-order symbolic
execution, explain the techniques we used to address such thorny issues,
formalize a notion of behavioral approximation, and use it to provide a
mechanized proof of soundness.

"  Existing approaches for restoring weather-degraded images follow a
fully-supervised paradigm and they require paired data for training. However,
collecting paired data for weather degradations is extremely challenging, and
existing methods end up training on synthetic data. To overcome this issue, we
describe an approach for supervising deep networks that are based on CycleGAN,
thereby enabling the use of unlabeled real-world data for training.
Specifically, we introduce new losses for training CycleGAN that lead to more
effective training, resulting in high-quality reconstructions. These new losses
are obtained by jointly modeling the latent space embeddings of predicted clean
images and original clean images through Deep Gaussian Processes. This enables
the CycleGAN architecture to transfer the knowledge from one domain
(weather-degraded) to another (clean) more effectively. We demonstrate that the
proposed method can be effectively applied to different restoration tasks like
de-raining, de-hazing and de-snowing and it outperforms other unsupervised
techniques (that leverage weather-based characteristics) by a considerable
margin.

"  We examine a class of techniques for 3D object manipulation on mobile

on the mapping between device motion and object motion. We review existing
manipulation techniques and introduce a formal description of the main mappings
under a common notation. Based on this notation, we analyze these mappings and
their properties in order to answer crucial usability questions. We first
investigate how the 3D objects should move on the screen, since the screen also
moves with the mobile device during manipulation. We then investigate the
effects of a limited range of manipulation and present a number of solutions to
overcome this constraint. This work provides a theoretical framework to better
understand the properties of locally-coupled 3D manipulation mappings based on
mobile device motion.

"  In-the-wild human pose estimation has a huge potential for various fields,
ranging from animation and action recognition to intention recognition and

using precise LiDAR depth information limits the performance and leads to very
inaccurate absolute pose estimation. With LiDAR sensors becoming more
affordable and common on robots and autonomous vehicle setups, we propose an
end-to-end architecture using RGB and LiDAR to predict the absolute 3D human

weakly-supervised approach to generate 3D predictions using 2D pose annotations
from PedX [1]. This allows for many new opportunities in the field of 3D human

"  This paper investigates the role of saliency to improve the classification
accuracy of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the case when scarce
training data is available. Our approach consists in adding a saliency branch
to an existing CNN architecture which is used to modulate the standard
bottom-up visual features from the original image input, acting as an
attentional mechanism that guides the feature extraction process. The main aim
of the proposed approach is to enable the effective training of a fine-grained
recognition model with limited training samples and to improve the performance
on the task, thereby alleviating the need to annotate large dataset. % The vast
majority of saliency methods are evaluated on their ability to generate
saliency maps, and not on their functionality in a complete vision pipeline.
Our proposed pipeline allows to evaluate saliency methods for the high-level
task of object recognition. We perform extensive experiments on various
fine-grained datasets (Flowers, Birds, Cars, and Dogs) under different
conditions and show that saliency can considerably improve the network's
performance, especially for the case of scarce training data. Furthermore, our
experiments show that saliency methods that obtain improved saliency maps (as
measured by traditional saliency benchmarks) also translate to saliency methods
that yield improved performance gains when applied in an object recognition
pipeline.

"  Discrete-time stochastic systems are an essential modelling tool for many
engineering systems. We consider stochastic control systems that are evolving
over continuous spaces. For this class of models, methods for the formal
verification and synthesis of control strategies are computationally hard and
generally rely on the use of approximate abstractions. Building on approximate
abstractions, we compute control strategies with lower- and upper-bounds for
satisfying unbounded temporal logic specifications. Firstly, robust dynamic
programming mappings over the abstract system are introduced to solve the
control synthesis and verification problem. These mappings yield a control
strategy and a unique lower bound on the satisfaction probability for temporal
logic specifications that is robust to the incurred approximation errors.
Secondly, upper-bounds on the satisfaction probability are quantified, and
properties of the mappings are analysed and discussed. Finally, we show the
implications of these results for linear stochastic dynamic systems with a
continuous state space. This abstraction-based synthesis framework is shown to
be able to handle infinite-horizon properties. Approximation errors expressed
as deviations in the outputs of the models and as deviations in the
probabilistic transitions are allowed and are quantified using approximate
stochastic simulation relations.

We prove that it can be solved in $2^{o(n)}$ time, where $n$ is the number of

  * the graphs in $\mathcal{C}$ are sparse, i.e., they have linearly many edges

"  Additive manufacturing technologies are positioned to provide an
unprecedented innovative transformation in how products are designed and

technologies, the final fabricated parts can vary significantly from the
original CAD models, therefore raising issues regarding accuracy, surface
finish, robustness, mechanical properties, functional and geometrical

  In this work we propose a novel approach to assessing the capability of a 3D

This is utilized by taking into consideration the model mesh complexity and
certain part characteristics. A printability score is derived for a model in
reference to a specific 3D printing technology, expressing the probability of
obtaining a robust and accurate end result for 3D printing on a specific AM

technology is more suitable for manufacturing a specific model or as a guide to
redesign the model to ensure printability. We verify this framework by
conducting 3D printing experiments for benchmark models which are printed on
three AM machines employing different technologies: Fused Deposition Modeling

"  Robotic tasks which involve uncertainty--due to variation in goal,
environment configuration, or confidence in task model--may require human input
to instruct or adapt the robot. In tasks with physical contact, several
existing methods for adapting robot trajectory or impedance according to
individual uncertainties have been proposed, e.g., realizing intention
detection or uncertainty-aware learning from demonstration. However, isolated
methods cannot address the wide range of uncertainties jointly present in many
tasks.
  To improve generality, this paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC)
framework which plans both trajectory and impedance online, can consider
discrete and continuous uncertainties, includes safety constraints, and can be
efficiently applied to a new task. This framework can consider uncertainty
from: contact constraint variation, uncertainty in human goals, or task
disturbances. An uncertainty-aware task model is learned from a few ($\leq3$)

MPC problem to optimize robot trajectory and impedance according to belief in
discrete human goals, human kinematics, safety constraints, contact stability,
and frequency-domain disturbance rejection. This MPC formulation is introduced,
analyzed with respect to convexity, and validated in co-manipulation with
multiple goals, a collaborative polishing task, and a collaborative assembly

"  Most previous image matting methods require a roughly-specificed trimap as
input, and estimate fractional alpha values for all pixels that are in the
unknown region of the trimap. In this paper, we argue that directly estimating
the alpha matte from a coarse trimap is a major limitation of previous methods,
as this practice tries to address two difficult and inherently different
problems at the same time: identifying true blending pixels inside the trimap
region, and estimate accurate alpha values for them. We propose AdaMatting, a
new end-to-end matting framework that disentangles this problem into two
sub-tasks: trimap adaptation and alpha estimation. Trimap adaptation is a
pixel-wise classification problem that infers the global structure of the input
image by identifying definite foreground, background, and semi-transparent
image regions. Alpha estimation is a regression problem that calculates the
opacity value of each blended pixel. Our method separately handles these two
sub-tasks within a single deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Extensive
experiments show that AdaMatting has additional structure awareness and trimap
fault-tolerance. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on Adobe

"  We consider the problem of online learning in misspecified linear stochastic
multi-armed bandit problems. Regret guarantees for state-of-the-art linear
bandit algorithms such as Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty Linear bandit
(OFUL) hold under the assumption that the arms expected rewards are perfectly
linear in their features. It is, however, of interest to investigate the impact
of potential misspecification in linear bandit models, where the expected
rewards are perturbed away from the linear subspace determined by the arms
features. Although OFUL has recently been shown to be robust to relatively
small deviations from linearity, we show that any linear bandit algorithm that
enjoys optimal regret performance in the perfectly linear setting (e.g., OFUL)
must suffer linear regret under a sparse additive perturbation of the linear
model. In an attempt to overcome this negative result, we define a natural
class of bandit models characterized by a non-sparse deviation from linearity.
We argue that the OFUL algorithm can fail to achieve sublinear regret even
under models that have non-sparse deviation.We finally develop a novel bandit
algorithm, comprising a hypothesis test for linearity followed by a decision to
use either the OFUL or Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. For perfectly
linear bandit models, the algorithm provably exhibits OFULs favorable regret
performance, while for misspecified models satisfying the non-sparse deviation
property, the algorithm avoids the linear regret phenomenon and falls back on
UCBs sublinear regret scaling. Numerical experiments on synthetic data, and on
recommendation data from the public Yahoo! Learning to Rank Challenge dataset,
empirically support our findings.

"  There exists a token imbalance phenomenon in natural language as different
tokens appear with different frequencies, which leads to different learning
difficulties for tokens in Neural Machine Translation (NMT). The vanilla NMT
model usually adopts trivial equal-weighted objectives for target tokens with
different frequencies and tends to generate more high-frequency tokens and less
low-frequency tokens compared with the golden token distribution. However,
low-frequency tokens may carry critical semantic information that will affect
the translation quality once they are neglected. In this paper, we explored
target token-level adaptive objectives based on token frequencies to assign
appropriate weights for each target token during training. We aimed that those
meaningful but relatively low-frequency words could be assigned with larger
weights in objectives to encourage the model to pay more attention to these
tokens. Our method yields consistent improvements in translation quality on
ZH-EN, EN-RO, and EN-DE translation tasks, especially on sentences that contain
more low-frequency tokens where we can get 1.68, 1.02, and 0.52 BLEU increases
compared with baseline, respectively. Further analyses show that our method can
also improve the lexical diversity of translation.

"  Region Proposal Network (RPN) is the cornerstone of two-stage object
detectors, it generates a sparse set of object proposals and alleviates the
extrem foregroundbackground class imbalance problem during training. However,
we find that the potential of the detector has not been fully exploited due to
the IoU distribution imbalance and inadequate quantity of the training samples
generated by RPN. With the increasing intersection over union (IoU), the
exponentially smaller numbers of positive samples would lead to the
distribution skewed towards lower IoUs, which hinders the optimization of
detector at high IoU levels. In this paper, to break through the limitations of
RPN, we propose IoU-Uniform R-CNN, a simple but effective method that directly
generates training samples with uniform IoU distribution for the regression
branch as well as the IoU prediction branch. Besides, we improve the
performance of IoU prediction branch by eliminating the feature offsets of RoIs

"  The well-known problem of state space explosion in model checking is even
more critical when applying this technique to programming languages, mainly due
to the presence of complex data structures. One recent and promising approach
to deal with this problem is the construction of an abstract and correct
representation of the global program state allowing to match visited states
during program model exploration. In particular, one powerful method to
implement abstract matching is to fill the state vector with a minimal amount
of relevant variables for each program point. In this paper, we combine the
on-the-fly model-checking approach (incremental construction of the program
state space) and the static analysis method called influence analysis
(extraction of significant variables for each program point) in order to
automatically construct an abstract matching function. Firstly, we describe the
problem as an alternation-free value-based mu-calculus formula, whose validity
can be checked on the program model expressed as a labeled transition system
(LTS). Secondly, we translate the analysis into the local resolution of a
parameterised boolean equation system (PBES), whose representation enables a
more efficient construction of the resulting abstract matching function.
Finally, we show how our proposal may be elegantly integrated into CADP, a
generic framework for both the design and analysis of distributed systems and
the development of verification tools.

"  To support the growing demands of neuroscience applications, researchers are
transitioning to cloud computing for its scalable, robust and elastic
infrastructure. Nevertheless, large datasets residing in object stores may
result in significant data transfer overheads during workflow execution.
Prefetching, a method to mitigate the cost of reading in mixed workloads, masks
data transfer costs within processing time of prior tasks. We present an
implementation of ""Rolling Prefetch"", a Python library that implements a
particular form of prefetching from AWS S3 object store, and we quantify its
benefits.
  Rolling Prefetch extends S3Fs, a Python library exposing AWS S3 functionality
via a file object, to add prefetch capabilities. In measured analysis
performance of a 500 GB brain connectivity dataset stored on S3, we found that
prefetching provides significant speed-ups of up to 1.86x, even in applications
consisting entirely of data loading. The observed speed-up values are
consistent with our theoretical analysis. Our results demonstrate the
usefulness of prefetching for scientific data processing on cloud
infrastructures and provide an implementation applicable to various application
domains.

"  This paper presents a compact and accurate representation of 3D scenes that
are observed by a LiDAR sensor and a monocular camera. The proposed method is
based on the well-established Stixel model originally developed for stereo
vision applications. We extend this Stixel concept to incorporate data from
multiple sensor modalities. The resulting mid-level fusion scheme takes full
advantage of the geometric accuracy of LiDAR measurements as well as the high
resolution and semantic detail of RGB images. The obtained environment model
provides a geometrically and semantically consistent representation of the 3D
scene at a significantly reduced amount of data while minimizing information
loss at the same time. Since the different sensor modalities are considered as
input to a joint optimization problem, the solution is obtained with only minor
computational overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
multimodal Stixel algorithm on a manually annotated ground truth dataset. Our
results indicate that the proposed mid-level fusion of LiDAR and camera data
improves both the geometric and semantic accuracy of the Stixel model
significantly while reducing the computational overhead as well as the amount
of generated data in comparison to using a single modality on its own.

"  We use testing to check if a combinational circuit N always evaluates to 0.
The usual point of view is that to prove that N always evaluates to 0 one has
to check the value of N for all 2^|X| input assignments where X is the set of
input variables of N. We use the notion of a Stable Set of Assignments (SSA) to
show that one can build a complete test set (i.e. a test set proving that N
always evaluates to 0) that consists of less than 2^|X| tests. Given an
unsatisfiable CNF formula H(W), an SSA of H is a set of assignments to W
proving unsatisfiability of H. A trivial SSA is the set of all 2^|W|
assignments to W. Importantly, real-life formulas can have SSAs that are much
smaller than 2^|W|. Generating a complete test set for N using only the
machinery of SSAs is inefficient. We describe a much faster algorithm that
combines computation of SSAs with resolution derivation and produces a complete
test set for a ""projection"" of N on a subset of variables of N. We give
experimental results and describe potential applications of this algorithm.

"  Bilateral filter (BF) is a fast, lightweight and effective tool for image
denoising and well extended to point cloud denoising. However, it often
involves continual yet manual parameter adjustment; this inconvenience
discounts the efficiency and user experience to obtain satisfied denoising
results. We propose LBF, an end-to-end learnable bilateral filtering network
for point cloud denoising; to our knowledge, this is the first time. Unlike the
conventional BF and its variants that receive the same parameters for a whole
point cloud, LBF learns adaptive parameters for each point according its
geometric characteristic (e.g., corner, edge, plane), avoiding remnant noise,
wrongly-removed geometric details, and distorted shapes. Besides the learnable
paradigm of BF, we have two cores to facilitate LBF. First, different from the
local BF, LBF possesses a global-scale feature perception ability by exploiting
multi-scale patches of each point. Second, LBF formulates a geometry-aware
bi-directional projection loss, leading the denoising results to being faithful
to their underlying surfaces. Users can apply our LBF without any laborious
parameter tuning to achieve the optimal denoising results. Experiments show
clear improvements of LBF over its competitors on both synthetic and

"  Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a
fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve
extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw
during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply
changing the position representation method, though we find that current
methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a
simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases
(ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead,
it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to
their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model
on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of
length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding
model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11%

"  3D single object tracking plays an essential role in many applications, such
as autonomous driving. It remains a challenging problem due to the large
appearance variation and the sparsity of points caused by occlusion and limited
sensor capabilities. Therefore, contextual information across two consecutive
frames is crucial for effective object tracking. However, points containing
such useful information are often overlooked and cropped out in existing
methods, leading to insufficient use of important contextual knowledge. To
address this issue, we propose CXTrack, a novel transformer-based network for
3D object tracking, which exploits ConteXtual information to improve the
tracking results. Specifically, we design a target-centric transformer network
that directly takes point features from two consecutive frames and the previous
bounding box as input to explore contextual information and implicitly
propagate target cues. To achieve accurate localization for objects of all
sizes, we propose a transformer-based localization head with a novel center
embedding module to distinguish the target from distractors. Extensive
experiments on three large-scale datasets, KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo Open
Dataset, show that CXTrack achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance while
running at 34 FPS.

"  This paper presents a machine learning-based approach for predicting solar

metric. The approach includes data collection, pre-processing, feature
selection, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment. High-quality
data from multiple sources, including weather data, solar irradiance data, and
historical solar power generation data, are collected and pre-processed to
remove outliers, handle missing values, and normalize the data. Relevant
features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar irradiance are
selected for model training. Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and
Gradient Boosting are used as machine learning algorithms to produce accurate
predictions. The models are trained on a large dataset of historical solar
power generation data and other relevant features. The performance of the
models is evaluated using AUC and other metrics such as precision, recall, and
F1-score. The trained machine learning models are then deployed in a production
environment, where they can be used to make real-time predictions about solar
power generation. The results show that the proposed approach achieves a 99%

"  Given the complexity and heterogeneity in Cloud computing scenarios, the
modeling approach has widely been employed to investigate and analyze the
energy consumption of Cloud applications, by abstracting real-world objects and

different research works. Therefore, it would be necessary and valuable to

"  Retrieving relevant items that match users' queries from billion-scale corpus
forms the core of industrial e-commerce search systems, in which
embedding-based retrieval (EBR) methods are prevailing. These methods adopt a
two-tower framework to learn embedding vectors for query and item separately
and thus leverage efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search to
retrieve relevant items. However, existing EBR methods usually ignore
inconsistent user behaviors in industrial multi-stage search systems, resulting
in insufficient retrieval efficiency with a low commercial return. To tackle
this challenge, we propose to improve EBR methods by learning Multi-level
Multi-Grained Semantic Embeddings(MMSE). We propose the multi-stage information
mining to exploit the ordered, clicked, unclicked and random sampled items in
practical user behavior data, and then capture query-item similarity via a
post-fusion strategy. We then propose multi-grained learning objectives that
integrate the retrieval loss with global comparison ability and the ranking
loss with local comparison ability to generate semantic embeddings. Both
experiments on a real-world billion-scale dataset and online A/B tests verify
the effectiveness of MMSE in achieving significant performance improvements on

Even assuming a conservative SED, they produce a major contribution to the 140
mu m DIRBE background measured by Hauser et al. (1998, 25.1+/-7 nW m^-2 sr^-1)
and Lagache et al. (1999, 15.3+/-9.5 nW m^ -2 sr^-1). This is both a
confirmation of the strong IR cosmic background that was first detected by
Puget et al. (1996) and the first identification of the galaxies responsible
for a large fraction of this background at 140 microns. We find that these
bright (several 10^11 Lsol) and massive (<M>= 1.5x10^11 Msol) IR galaxies have
a typical redshift of z=0.7 and optical colors similar to field galaxies. The
fraction of galaxies with morphological signs of interactions is larger at
higher redshift. This is consistent with the nature of local luminous IR
galaxies found by IRAS, which often exhibit evidence of galaxy interaction or
merging and indicates that interactions should play a crucial role in the
evolution of galaxies as expected from bottom-up scenarios.

to obtain wide-field, high-resolution images of the X-ray luminous galaxy
cluster XMMU J2235.3-2557 in the J and Ks bands, and we use these images to
build a colour-magnitude diagram of cluster galaxies. Galaxies in the core of
the cluster form a tight red sequence with a mean J-Ks colour of 1.9 (Vega
system). The intrinsic scatter in the colour of galaxies that lie on the red
sequence is similar to that measured for galaxies on the red sequence of the
Coma cluster. The slope and location of the red sequence can be modelled by
passively evolving the red sequence of the Coma cluster backwards in time.
Using simple stellar population (SSP) models, we find that galaxies in the core
of XMMU J2235.3-2557 are, even at z=1.39, already 3 Gyr old, corresponding to a
formation redshift of z ~ 4. Outside the core, the intrinsic scatter and the
fraction of galaxies actively forming stars increase substantially. Using SSP
models, we find that most of these galaxies will join the red sequence within
1.5 Gyr. The contrast between galaxies in the cluster core and galaxies in the
cluster outskirts indicates that the red sequence of XMMU J2235.3-2557 is being
built from the dense cluster core outwards.

produced by multiple supernova (SN) explosions from an OB association. Here we
perform a Montecarlo simulation of the pulsar population associated with
supershells powered by multiple SNe. We predict that several tens of radio
pulsars could be detected with current instruments associated with the largest
Galactic supershells (with kinetic energies >~ 10^{53} ergs), and a few pulsars
with the smaller ones. We test these predictions for some of the supershells
which lie in regions covered by past pulsar surveys. For the smaller
supershells, our results are consistent with the few detected pulsars per
bubble. For the giant supershell GSH 242-03+37, we find the multiple SN
hypothesis inconsistent with current data at the 95% level. We stress the
importance of undertaking deep pulsar surveys in correlation with supershells.

serious constraints on the multiple SN origin for them. Conversely, the
discovery of the pulsar population associated with a supershell would allow a

"  Context. Synthetic model atmosphere calculations are still the most commonly
used tool when determining precise stellar parameters and stellar chemical
compositions. Besides three-dimensional models that consistently solve for
hydrodynamic processes, one-dimensional models that use an approximation for
convective energy transport play the major role.
  Aims. We use modern Balmer-line formation theory as well as spectral energy
distribution (SED) measurements for the Sun and Procyon to calibrate the model
parameter {\alpha} that describes the efficiency of convection in our 1D
models. Convection was calibrated over a significant range in parameter space,
reaching from F-K along the main sequence and sampling the turnoff and giant
branch over a wide range of metallicities. This calibration was compared to
theoretical evaluations and allowed an accurate modeling of stellar
atmospheres.
  Methods. We used Balmer-line fitting and SED fits to determine the convective
efficiency parameter {\alpha}. Both methods are sensitive to the structure and
temperature stratification of the deeper photosphere.
  Results. While SED fits do not allow a precise determination of the
convective parameter for the Sun and Procyon, they both favor values
significantly higher than 1.0. Balmer-line fitting, which we find to be more
sensitive, suggests that the convective efficiency parameter {\alpha} is
$\approx$ 2.0 for the main sequence and quickly decreases to $\approx$ 1.0 for
evolved stars. These results are highly consistent with predictions from 3D
models. While the values on the main sequence fit predictions very well,
measurements suggest that the decrease of convective efficiency as stars evolve
to the giant branch is more dramatic than predicted by models.

"  When the accretion disc around a weakly magnetised neutron star (NS) meets
the stellar surface, it should brake down to match the rotation of the NS,
forming a boundary layer. As the mechanisms potentially responsible for this
braking are apparently inefficient, it is reasonable to consider this layer as
a spreading layer (SL) with negligible radial extent and structure. We perform
hydrodynamical 2D spectral simulations of an SL, considering the disc as a
source of matter and angular momentum. Interaction of new, rapidly rotating
matter with the pre-existing, relatively slow material co-rotating with the
star leads to instabilities capable of transferring angular momentum and
creating variability on dynamical timescales. For small accretion rates, we
find that the SL is unstable for heating instability that disrupts the initial
latitudinal symmetry and produces large deviations between the two hemispheres.
This instability also results in breaking of the axial symmetry as coherent
flow structures are formed and escape from the SL intermittently. At enhanced
accretion rates, the SL is prone to shearing instability and acts as a source
of oblique waves that propagate towards the poles, leading to patterns that
again break the axial symmetry. We compute artificial light curves of an SL
viewed at different inclination angles. Most of the simulated light curves show
oscillations at frequencies close to 1kHz. We interpret these oscillations as
inertial modes excited by shear instabilities near the boundary of the SL.
Their frequencies, dependence on flux, and amplitude variations can explain the
high-frequency pair quasi-periodic oscillations observed in many low-mass X-ray
binaries.

intensities turned into emission at $<$ twice the continuum intensity. Their
linear polarization profiles are of the same sign across the multiplet
including 1082.9 nm, intensity-like, at $<5$\% of the continuum intensity.
Weaker Zeeman-induced linear polarization is also observed. Only the strongest
linear polarization coincides with hard X-ray (HXR) emission at 30-70 keV
observed by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscope Imager. The
polarization is generally more extended and lasts longer than the HXR emission.
The upper $J=0$ level of the 1082.9~nm component is unpolarizable, thus lower
level polarization is the culprit. We make non-LTE radiative transfer
calculations in thermal slabs optimized to fit only intensities. The linear
polarizations are naturally reproduced, through a systematic change of sign
with wavelength of the radiation anisotropy when slab optical depths of the
1082.9 component are $< 1$. Collisions with beams of particles are neither
needed nor can they produce the same sign of polarization of the 1082.9 and
1083.0 nm components. The He I line polarization merely requires heating
sufficient to produce slabs of the required thickness. Widely different
polarizations of H$\alpha$, reported previously, are explained by different

addition to a number of point sources in the vicinity of NGC1365, we find a
region of X-ray emission extending along the central bar of the galaxy,

emission is centred on the optical/radio nucleus, but is spatially extended.
The X-ray spectrum can be well fitted by a thermal plasma model, with
kT=0.6-0.8keV and a low local absorbing column. The thermal spectrum is
suggestive of starburst emission rather than emission from a central
black-hole.
  The ATCA radio observations show a number of hotspots, located in a ring
around a weak radio nucleus. Synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated by
supernovae and supernova remnants (SNRs) is the likely origin of these
hotspots. The radio nucleus has a steep spectrum, indicative perhaps of an AGN
or SNRs. The evidence for a jet emanating from the nucleus is at best marginal.
The extent of the radio ring is comparable to the extended central X-ray

"  Most studies of mass transfer in binary systems assume circular orbits at the
onset of Roche lobe overflow. However, there are theoretical and observational
indications that mass transfer could occur in eccentric orbits. In particular,
eccentricity could be produced via sudden mass loss and velocity kicks during
supernova explosions, or Lidov-Kozai (LK) oscillations in hierarchical triple
systems, or, more generally, secular evolution in multiple-star systems.
However, current analytic models of eccentric mass transfer are faced with the
problem that they are only well defined in the limit of very high
eccentricities, and break down for less eccentric and circular orbits. This
provides a major obstacle to implementing such models in binary and
higher-order population synthesis codes, which are useful tools for studying
the long-term evolution of a large number of systems. Here, we present a new
analytic model to describe the secular orbital evolution of binaries undergoing
conservative mass transfer. The main improvement of our model is that the mass
transfer rate is a smoothly varying function of orbital phase, rather than a
delta function centered at periapsis. Consequently, our model is in principle
valid for any eccentricity, thereby overcoming the main limitation of previous
works. We implement our model in an easy-to-use and publicly available code
that can be used as a basis for implementations of our model into population
synthesis codes. We investigate the implications of our model in a number of
applications with circular and eccentric binaries, and triples undergoing LK
oscillations.

"  We investigate the relationship between the continuum enhancement and the
hard X-ray (HXR) emission of a white-light flare on 2002 September 29. By
reconstructing the RHESSI HXR images in the impulsive phase, we find two bright
conjugate footpoints (FPs) on the two sides of the magnetic neutral line. Using
the thick-target model and assuming a low-energy cutoff of 20 keV, the energy
fluxes of non-thermal electron beams bombarding FPs A and B are estimated to be
1.0 10^10 and 0.8 10^10 ergs/cm^2/s, respectively. However, the continuum
enhancement at the two FPs is not simply proportional to the electron beam
flux. The continuum emission at FP B is relatively strong with a maximum
enhancement of about 8% and correlates temporally well with the HXR profile;
however, that at FP A is less significant with an enhancement of only about
4-5%, regardless of the relatively strong beam flux. By carefully inspecting
the Halpha line profiles, we ascribe such a contrast to different atmospheric
conditions at the two FPs. The Halpha line profile at FP B exhibits a
relatively weak amplitude with a pronounced central reversal, while the profile
at FP A is fairly strong without a visible central reversal. This indicates
that in the early impulsive phase of the flare, the local atmosphere at FP A
has been appreciably heated and the coronal pressure is high enough to prevent
most high-energy electrons from penetrating into the deeper atmosphere; while
at FP B, the atmosphere has not been fully heated, the electron beam can
effectively heat the chromosphere and produce the observed continuum
enhancement via the radiative backwarming effect.

"  Tidal interactions of galaxies in galaxy clusters have been proposed as one
potential explanation of the morphology-density relation at low masses. The
efficiency of tidal transformation is expected to depend strongly on the orbit
of a galaxy within the cluster halo. The orbit determines both the strength of
the cluster's global tidal field and the probability of encounters with other
cluster members. Additionally, we investigate the effect of an inclination
between the disk of the infalling galaxy and its orbital plane. We also compare
our results to observational data. We find that galaxies that entered a cluster
from the outskirts are unlikely to be significantly transformed. Closer to the
cluster centre, tidal interactions are a more efficient mechanism for producing
harassed galaxies. But the inclination of the disk can reduce the mass loss
significantly, yet it amplifies the thickening.

"  (abridged) The discovery of OGLE 2005-BLG-390Lb, the first cool rocky/icy
exoplanet, impressively demonstrated the sensitivity of the microlensing
technique to extra-solar planets below 10 M_earth. A planet of 1 M_earth in the
same spot would have provided a detectable deviation with an amplitude of ~ 3 %
and a duration of ~ 12 h. An early detection of a deviation could trigger
higher-cadence sampling which would have allowed the discovery of an Earth-mass
planet in this case. Here, we describe the implementation of an automated
anomaly detector, embedded into the eSTAR system, that profits from immediate
feedback provided by the robotic telescopes that form the RoboNet-1.0 network.
It went into operation for the 2007 microlensing observing season. As part of
our discussion about an optimal strategy for planet detection, we shed some new
light on whether concentrating on highly-magnified events is promising and
planets in the 'resonant' angular separation equal to the angular Einstein
radius are revealed most easily. Given that sub-Neptune mass planets can be
considered being common around the host stars probed by microlensing
(preferentially M- and K-dwarfs), the higher number of events that can be
monitored with a network of 2m telescopes and the increased detection
efficiency for planets below 5 M_earth arising from an optimized strategy gives
a common effort of current microlensing campaigns a fair chance to detect an
Earth-mass planet (from the ground) ahead of the COROT or Kepler missions. The
detection limit of gravitational microlensing extends even below 0.1 M_earth,
but such planets are not very likely to be detected from current campaigns.
However, these will be within the reach of high-cadence monitoring with a
network of wide-field telescopes or a space-based telescope.

"  High-contrast imaging provided by a coronagraph is critical for the direction
imaging of the Earth-like planet orbiting its bright parent star. A major
limitation for such direct imaging is the speckle noise that is induced from
the wave-front error of an optical system. We derive an algorithm for the
wave-front measurement directly from 3 focal plane images. The 3 images are
achieved through a deformable mirror to provide specific phases for the optics
system. We introduce an extra amplitude modulation on one deformable mirror
configuration to create an uncorrelated wave-front, which is a critical
procedure for wave-front sensing. The simulation shows that the reconstructed
wave-front is consistent with the original wave-front theoretically, which
indicates that such an algorithm is a promising technique for the wave-front
measurement for the high-contrast imaging.

"  In this work we consider the eruption of a tenuous relativistic hydrodynamic
jet from a dense baryonic envelope. As the jet moves out and away, it carries
along and continues to accelerate a layer of baryonic material which we refer
to as the plug. We solve the relativistic equations of motion for the
trajectory of the plug, and verify it using a relativistic hydrodynamic
simulation. We show that under these conditions, the plug breaks up at a radius
larger by a factor of a few from the radius of the envelope, due to the onset
of the Rayleigh Taylor instability. After breakup the jet continues to
accelerate to higher Lorentz factors while the plug fragments maintain a
moderate Lorentz factor. The presence of slower moving ejecta can explain late

"  I propose to compare the redshift-space density field directly to the
REAL-SPACE velocity field. Such a comparison possesses all of the advantages of
the conventional redshift-space analyses, while at the same time it is free of
their disadvantages. In particular, the model-dependent reconstruction of the
density field in real space is unnecessary, and so is the reconstruction of the
velocity field in redshift space. The redshift-space velocity field can be
reconstructed only at the linear order, because only at this order it is
irrotational. Unlike the conventional redshift-space density--velocity
comparisons, the comparison proposed here does not have to be restricted to the
linear regime. Nonlinear effects can then be used to break the Omega-bias
degeneracy plaguing the analyses based on the linear theory. I present a
degeneracy-breaking method for the case of nonlinear but local bias.

"  We investigate whether models based on the assumption that jets in quasars
are powered by rotating black holes can explain the observed radio dichotomy of
quasars. We show that in terms of the ``spin paradigm'' models, radio-loud
quasars could be objects in which the black hole's rotation rate corresponds to
an equilibrium between spin-up by accretion and spin-down by the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism. Radio-quiet quasars could be hosting black holes
with an average spin much smaller than the equilibrium one. We discuss possible
accretion scenarios which can lead to such a bimodal distribution of black hole
spins.

"  If broad absorption line (BAL) quasars represent a high covering fraction
evolutionary state (even if this is not the sole factor governing the presence
of BALs), it is expected that they should show an excess of mid-infrared
radiation compared to normal quasars. Some previous studies have suggested that
this is not the case. We perform the first analysis of the IR properties of
radio-loud BAL quasars, using IR data from WISE and optical (rest-frame
ultraviolet) data from SDSS, and compare the BAL quasar sample with a
well-matched sample of unabsorbed quasars. We find a statistically significant
excess in the mid- to near-infrared luminosities of BAL quasars, particularly
at rest-frame wavelengths of 1.5 and 4 microns. Our sample was previously used
to show that BALs are observed along many lines of sight towards quasars, but
with an overabundance of more edge-on sources, suggesting that orientation
factors into the appearance of BALs. The evidence here---of a difference in IR
luminosities between BAL quasars and unabsorbed quasars---may be ascribed to
evolution. This suggests that a merging of the current BAL paradigms is needed
to fully describe the class.

"  We study the variability of the nova-like cataclysmic variable TT Ari, on
time-scales of between minutes and months. The observations in the filter R
were obtained at the 40-cm telescope of the Chungbuk National University
(Korea). TT Ari was in the ""negative superhump"" state after its return from the
""positive superhump"" state, which lasted 8 years. The ephemeris for 12 best
pronounced minima is $T_{min}=BJD 2453747.0700(47)+0.132322(53)E.$ where
numbers in digits are errors in units of the last digit. The phases of minima
may reach 0.2, indicating non-eclipse nature of these minima. The
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) are present with a mean ""period"" of 21.6 min
and mean semi-amplitude of 36 mmag. This value is consistent with the range
15-25 minutes reported for previous ""negative superhump"" states and does not
support the hypothesis of secular decrease of the QPO period.
  Either the period, or the semi-amplitude show significant night-to-night
variations. According to the position at the two-parameter diagrams, the
interval of observations was splitted into 5 parts, showing different
characteristics which are discussed in this paper. The system is an excellent
laboratory to study processes resulting in variations at time-scales from

"  We make a simple analytical study of radial profiles of dark matter
structures, with special attention to the question of the central radial
density profile. We let our theoretical assumptions be guided by results from
numerical simulations, and show that at any radius where both the radial
density profile, rho, and the phase-space-like density profile,
rho/sigma^epsilon, are exact power laws, the only allowed density slopes in
agreement with the spherical symmetric and isotropic Jeans equation are in the
range 1< beta <3, where beta = - dln(rho)/dln(r). We also allow for a radial
variation of these power laws, as well as anisotropy, and show how this allows
for more shallow central slopes.

"  We present the first detailed kinematical analysis of the planetary nebula
Abell 63, which is known to contain the eclipsing close-binary nucleus UU Sge.
Abell 63 provides an important test case in investigating the role of
close-binary central stars on the evolution of planetary nebulae.
  Longslit observations were obtained using the Manchester echelle spectrometer
combined with the 2.1-m San Pedro Martir Telescope. The spectra reveal that the
central bright rim of Abell 63 has a tube-like structure. A deep image shows
collimated lobes extending from the nebula, which are shown to be high-velocity
outflows. The kinematic ages of the nebular rim and the extended lobes are
calculated to be 8400+/-500 years and 12900+/-2800 years, respectively, which
suggests that the lobes were formed at an earlier stage than the nebular rim.
This is consistent with expectations that disk-generated jets form immediately
after the common envelope phase.
  A morphological-kinematical model of the central nebula is presented and the
best-fit model is found to have the same inclination as the orbital plane of
the central binary system; this is the first proof that a close-binary system
directly affects the shaping of its nebula. A Hubble-type flow is
well-established in the morphological-kinematical modelling of the observed
line profiles and imagery.
  Two possible formation models for the elongated lobes of Abell 63 are
considered (1) a low-density, pressure-driven jet excavates a cavity in the
remnant AGB envelope; (2) high-density bullets form the lobes in a single
ballistic ejection event.

"  The observational expectation of polarization measurements of thermal dust
radiation is investigated to find information on molecular outflows based on
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) and radiation transfer simulations. There are two
major proposed models for the driving of molecular outflows: (1) molecular gas
is accelerated by a magnetic pressure gradient or magnetocentrifugal wind
mechanism before the magnetic field and molecular gas are decoupled, (2) the
linear momentum of a highly collimated jet is transferred to the ambient
molecular gas. In order to distinguish between these two models, it is crucial
to observe the configuration of the magnetic field. An observation of a
toroidal magnetic field is strong evidence that the first of the models is
appropriate. In this paper, we calculated the polarization distribution of
thermal dust radiation due to the alignment of dust grains along the magnetic
field using molecular outflow data calculated by two-dimensional axisymmetric
MHD simulations. An asymmetric distribution around the z-axis is characteristic
for magnetic fields composed of both poloidal and toroidal components. We
determined that the outflow has a low polarization degree compared with the
envelope and that the envelope and outflow have different polarization
directions (B-vector), namely, the magnetic field within the envelope is
parallel to the global magnetic field lines while the magnetic field of the
outflow is perpendicular to it. Thus we have demonstrated that the
point-symmetric (rather than axisymmetric) distributions of low polarization
regions indicate that molecular outflows are likely to be magnetically driven.
Observations of this polarization distribution with tools such as ALMA would
confirm the origin of the molecular outflow.

"  We present a study of the gas cycle and star formation history in the central
500 pc of the Milky Way, known as Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). Through
hydrodynamical simulations of the inner 4.5 kpc of our Galaxy, we follow the
gas cycle in a completely self-consistent way, starting from gas radial inflow
due to the Galactic bar, the channelling of this gas into a dense, star-forming
ring/stream at ~ 200 - 300 pc from the Galactic centre, and the launching of
galactic outflows powered by stellar feedback. We find that star formation
activity in the CMZ goes through oscillatory burst/quench cycles, with a period
of tens to hundreds of Myr, characterised by roughly constant gas mass but
order-of-magnitude level variations in the star formation rate. Comparison with
the observed present-day star formation rate of the CMZ suggests that we are
currently near a minimum of this cycle. Stellar feedback drives a mainly
two-phase wind off the Galactic disc. The warm phase dominates the mass flux,
and carries 100 - 200 % of the gas mass converted into stars. However, most of
this gas goes into a fountain and falls back onto the disc rather than escaping
the Galaxy. The hot phase carries most of the energy, with a time-averaged
energy outflow rate of 10 - 20 % of the supernova energy budget.

INTEGRAL data obtained during the 2011 outburst for a dynamic range of its
luminosities (~10^{37} - 7 x 10^{37} erg/s). We show that apart from the
fundamental harmonic of the cyclotron absorption line at energy ~11 keV, its
four higher harmonics at energies ~24, 35.6, 48.8, and 60.7 keV are detected in
the spectrum. We have performed a detailed analysis of the source's spectra in
the 4-28 keV energy band based on all of the available RXTE archival data
obtained during bright outbursts in 1995-2011. We have confirmed that modifying
the source's continuum model can lead to the disappearance of the observed
anticorrelation between the energy of the fundamental harmonic of the cyclotron
absorption line and the source's luminosity. Thus, the question about the
evolution of the cyclotron absorption line energy with the luminosity of the
X-ray pulsar 4U 0115+63 remains open and a physically justified radiation model
for X-ray pulsars is needed to answer it.
