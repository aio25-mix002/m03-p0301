"  We use super-paramagnetic spherical particles which are arranged in a
two-dimensional monolayer at a water/air interface to investigate the crystal
to liquid phase transition. According to the KTHNY theory a crystal melts in
thermal equilibrium by two continuous phase transitions into the isotropic
liquid state with an intermediate phase, commonly known as hexatic phase. We
verify the significance of several criteria based on dynamical and structural
properties to identify the crystal - hexatic and hexatic - isotropic liquid
phase transition for the same experimental data of the given setup. Those
criteria are the bond orientational correlation function, the Larson-Grier
criterion, 2D dynamic Lindemann parameter, the bond-orientational
susceptibility, the 2D Hansen-Verlet rule, the L\""{o}wen-Palberg-Simon
criterion as well as a criterion based on the shape factor of Voronoi cells and
Minkowski functionals. For our system with long range repulsion, the bond order
correlation function and bond order susceptibility works best to identify the
hexatic - isotropic liquid transition and the 2D dynamic Lindemann parameter
identifies unambiguously the hexatic - crystalline transition.

"  One-class classification (OCC) aims to learn an effective data description to
enclose all normal training samples and detect anomalies based on the deviation
from the data description. Current state-of-the-art OCC models learn a compact
normality description by hyper-sphere minimisation, but they often suffer from
overfitting the training data, especially when the training set is small or
contaminated with anomalous samples. To address this issue, we introduce the
interpolated Gaussian descriptor (IGD) method, a novel OCC model that learns a
one-class Gaussian anomaly classifier trained with adversarially interpolated
training samples. The Gaussian anomaly classifier differentiates the training
samples based on their distance to the Gaussian centre and the standard
deviation of these distances, offering the model a discriminability w.r.t. the
given samples during training. The adversarial interpolation is enforced to
consistently learn a smooth Gaussian descriptor, even when the training data is
small or contaminated with anomalous samples. This enables our model to learn
the data description based on the representative normal samples rather than
fringe or anomalous samples, resulting in significantly improved normality
description. In extensive experiments on diverse popular benchmarks, including
MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10, MVTec AD and two medical datasets, IGD achieves
better detection accuracy than current state-of-the-art models. IGD also shows
better robustness in problems with small or contaminated training sets. Code is
available at https://github.com/tianyu0207/IGD.

"  We derive Galactic continuum spectra from 5-96/cm from COBE/FIRAS
observations. The spectra are dominated by warm dust emission, which may be fit
with a single temperature in the range 16-21 K (for nu^2 emissivity) along each
line of sight. Dust heated by the attenuated radiation field in molecular
clouds gives rise to intermediate temperature (10-14 K) emission in the inner
Galaxy only. A widespread, very cold component (4-7 K) with optical depth that
is spatially correlated with the warm component is also detected. The cold
component is unlikely to be due to very cold dust shielded from starlight,
because it is present at high latitude. We consider hypotheses that the cold
component is due to enhanced submillimeter emissivity of the dust that gives
rise to the warm component, or that it may be due to very small, large, or
fractal particles. Lack of substantial power above the emission from warm dust
places strong constraints on the amount of cold gas in the Galaxy. The
microwave sky brightness due to interstellar dust is dominated by the cold
component, and its angular variation could limit our ability to discern
primordial fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation.

"  In the 1950's, English painter Anthony Hill described drawings of complete
graphs $K_n$ in the plane having precisely $$H(n) = \tfrac{1}{4}\lfloor
\tfrac{n}{2}\rfloor \, \lfloor \tfrac{n-1}{2}\rfloor \, \lfloor
\tfrac{n-2}{2}\rfloor \,\lfloor \tfrac{n-3}{2}\rfloor$$ crossings. It became a
conjecture that this number is minimum possible and, despite serious efforts,
the conjecture is still widely open. Another way of drawing $K_n$ with the same
number of crossings was found by Bla\v{z}ek and Koman in 1963. In this note we
provide, for the first time, a very general construction of drawings attaining
the same bound. Surprisingly, the proof is extremely short and may as well
qualify as a ""book proof"". In particular, it gives a very simple explanation of
the phenomenon discovered by Moon in 1968 that a random set of $n$ points on
the unit sphere $\SS^2$ in $\RR^3$ joined by geodesics gives rise to a drawing
whose number of crossings asymptotically approaches the Hill value $H(n)$.

"  We evidence via a computation in the reciprocal space the asymptotic
behaviour of the high order virial coefficients for a hard sphere system. These
coefficients, if their order is high enough, are those of a geometric series.
We thus are able to give an explicit expression of the equation of states of
the hard sphere system at high density when the fluid phase is no longer the
stable one; in the disordered phase this equation of states exhibits a simple
pole at the random close packing density. We can then estimate the packing
densities of the freezing point of the disordered phase and also of the melting
point of the fcc ordered phase. The results are compared with those of the
numerical simulations.

"  Protostellar feedback, both radiation and bipolar outflows, dramatically
affects the fragmentation and mass accretion from star-forming cores. We use
ORION, an adaptive mesh refinement gravito-radiation-hydrodynamics code, to
simulate the formation of a cluster of low-mass stars, including both radiative
transfer and protostellar outflows. We ran four simulations to isolate the
individual effects of radiation feedback and outflow feedback as well as the
combination of the two. Outflows reduce protostellar masses and accretion rates
each by a factor of three and therefore reduce protostellar luminosities by an
order of magnitude. Thus, while radiation feedback suppresses fragmentation,
outflows render protostellar radiation largely irrelevant for low-mass star
formation above a mass scale of 0.05 M_sun. We find initial fragmentation of
our cloud at half the global Jeans length, ~ 0.1 pc. With insufficient
protostellar radiation to stop it, these 0.1 pc cores fragment repeatedly,
forming typically 10 stars each. The accretion rate in these stars scales with
mass as predicted from core accretion models that include both thermal and
turbulent motions. We find that protostellar outflows do not significantly
affect the overall cloud dynamics, in the absence of magnetic fields, due to
their small opening angles and poor coupling to the dense gas. The outflows
reduce the mass from the cores by 2/3, giving a core to star efficiency ~ 1/3.
The simulation with radiation and outflows reproduces the observed protostellar
luminosity function. All of the simulations can reproduce observed core mass
functions, though they are sensitive to telescope resolution. The simulation
with both radiation and outflows reproduces the galactic IMF and the two-point
correlation function of the cores observed in rho Oph.

"  The radiative cooling time of the X-ray-emitting plasma near the center in
many clusters of galaxies is shorter than the age of the cluster, but neither
the expected large drop in central temperature --nor the expected mass flow
towards the pressure-depleted cluster centers-- are observed. We propose a
solution to these ``cooling flow'' problems wherein energy is supplied to the
plasma by hadronic cosmic rays (CRs). The solution requires an energy
deposition more intense and more distributed than in conventional CR models,
but this alternative model is also successful in describing the origin of CRs,
as well as the properties of gamma ray bursts and of the diffuse gamma
background radiation. The X-ray energy emitted by clusters is supplied, in a
quasi-steady state, by the hadronic CRs, which act as ``warming rays''. The
temperature distribution in the intracluster space is successfully predicted
from the measured plasma-density distribution. Four other puzzling features of
clusters can also be explained in simple terms: the discrepancy between their
``virial'' and ``lensing'' masses, their large magnetic fields, the correlation
between their optical and X-ray luminosities, and the non-thermal tail of their
X-ray spectrum.

"  To produce accurate predictions, language models (LMs) must balance between
generalization and memorization. Yet, little is known about the mechanism by
which transformer LMs employ their memorization capacity. When does a model
decide to output a memorized phrase, and how is this phrase then retrieved from
memory? In this work, we offer the first methodological framework for probing
and characterizing recall of memorized sequences in transformer LMs. First, we
lay out criteria for detecting model inputs that trigger memory recall, and
propose idioms as inputs that typically fulfill these criteria. Next, we
construct a dataset of English idioms and use it to compare model behavior on
memorized vs. non-memorized inputs. Specifically, we analyze the internal
prediction construction process by interpreting the model's hidden
representations as a gradual refinement of the output probability distribution.
We find that across different model sizes and architectures, memorized
predictions are a two-step process: early layers promote the predicted token to
the top of the output distribution, and upper layers increase model confidence.
This suggests that memorized information is stored and retrieved in the early
layers of the network. Last, we demonstrate the utility of our methodology
beyond idioms in memorized factual statements. Overall, our work makes a first
step towards understanding memory recall, and provides a methodological basis
for future studies of transformer memorization.

The computed Kohn-Sham (K-S) energy difference between these two interaction

for the stable hydrogen-bonding network. We have further estimated the
individual bonding strength for the ten relevant hydrogen bonds having a bond
critical point. The net difference in the total hydrogen-bonding energies
between these two interaction modes is 43.87 meV per MA-site, which nearly
coincides with the K-S energy difference of 45.14 meV.

"  We present results of a study of the galactic open cluster population based
on the all-sky catalogue ASCC-2.5 (I/280A) compiled from Tycho-2, Hipparcos and
other catalogues. The sample of optical clusters from ASCC-2.5 is complete up
to about 850 pc from the Sun. The symmetry plane of the clusters' distribution
is determined to be at $Z_0=-22\pm4$ pc, and the scale height of open clusters
is only $56\pm3$ pc. The total surface density and volume density in the
symmetry plane are $\Sigma=$ 114 kpc$^{-2}$ and $D(Z_0)=1015$ kpc$^{-3}$,
respectively. We find the total number of open clusters in the Galactic disk to
be of order of 10$^5$ at present. Fluctuations in the spatial and velocity
distributions are attributed to the existence of four open cluster complexes
(OCCs) of different ages containing up to a few tens of clusters. Members in an
OCC show the same kinematic behaviour, and a narrow age spread. We find, that
the youngest cluster complex, OCC~1 ($\log t<7.9$), with 19 deg inclination to
the Galactic plane, is apparently a signature of Gould's Belt. The most
abundant OCC~2 complex has moderate age ($\log t\approx8.45$). The clusters of
the Perseus-Auriga group, having the same age as OCC~2, but different
kinematics are seen in breaks between Perseus-Auriga clouds. The oldest ($\log
t\approx8.85$) and sparsest group was identified due to a large motion in the
Galactic anticentre direction. Formation rate and lifetime of open clusters are
found to be $0.23\pm0.03$ kpc$^{-2}$Myr$^{-1}$ and 322$\pm$31 Myr,
respectively. This implies a total number of cluster generations in the history
of the Galaxy between 30 to 40. We estimate that less than about 10% of the
total Galactic stellar disk population has ever passed an open cluster
membership.

"  It is possible to reduce the discrepancy between the local measurement of the
cosmological parameter $H_0$ and the value derived from the $Planck$
measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by considering
contamination of the CMB by emission from some medium around distant
extragalactic sources, such as extremely cold coarse-grain dust. Though being
distant, such a medium would still be in the foreground with respect to the
CMB, and, as any other foreground, it would alter the CMB power spectrum. This
could contribute to the dispersion of CMB temperature fluctuations. By
generating a few random samples of CMB with different dispersions, we have
checked that the increased dispersion leads to a smaller estimated value of
$H_0$, the rest of the cosmological model parameters remaining fixed. This
might explain the reduced value of the $Planck$-derived parameter $H_0$ with
respect to the local measurements. The signature of the distant foreground in
the CMB traced by SNe was previously reported by the authors of this paper --
we found a correlation between the SN redshifts, $z_{\rm SN}$, and CMB
temperature fluctuations at the SNe locations, $T_{\rm SN}$. Here we have used
the slopes of the regression lines $T_{\rm SN}\,/\,z_{\rm SN}$ corresponding to
different {\it Planck} wave bands in order to estimate the possible temperature
of the distant extragalactic medium, which turns out to be very low, about
5\,K. The most likely ingredient of this medium is coarse-grain ($grey$) dust,
which is known to be almost undetectable, except for the effect of dimming
remote extragalactic sources.

"  We study the dynamics of a suspension of magnetic nanoparticles. Their
relaxation times are strongly size-dependent. The dominant mode of relaxation
is also governed by the size of the particles. As a result the dynamics is
greatly altered due to polydispersity in the sample. We study the effect of
polydispersity on the response functions. These exhibit significant changes as
the parameters characterizing polydispersity are varied. We also provide a
procedure to extract the particle size distribution in a polydisperse sample
using Cole-Cole plots. Further the presence of attractive interactions causes
aggregation of particles leading to the formation of clusters. Repulsive
interactions along with thermal disorder not only hinder aggregation, but also
introduce the possibility of removal of particles or ""fragmentation"" from
clusters. The competing mechanisms of aggregation and fragmentation yield a
distribution of cluster sizes in the steady-state. We attempt to understand the
formation of clusters and their distributions using a model incorporating the
phenomena of aggregation and fragmentation. Scaling forms for quantities of
interest have been obtained. Finally we compare our numerical results with
experimental data. These comparisons are satisfactory.

"  Observations of the optical polarization of NGC 4151 in 1997-2003 show
variations of an order of magnitude in the polarized flux while the
polarization position angle remains constant. The amplitude of variability of
the polarized flux is comparable to the amplitude of variability of the total
U-band flux, except that the polarized flux follows the total flux with a lag
of 8 +/- 3 days. The time lag and the constancy of the position angle strongly
favor a scattering origin for the variable polarization rather than a
non-thermal synchrotron origin. The orientation of the position angle of the
polarized flux (parallel to the radio axis) and the size of the lag imply that
the polarization arises from electron scattering in a flattened region within
the low-ionization component of the broad-line-region. Polarization from dust
scattering in the equatorial torus is ruled out as the source of the lag in
polarized flux because it would produce a larger lag and, unless the
half-opening angle of the torus is more than 53 degrees, the polarization would
be perpendicular to the radio axis. We note a long-term change in the
percentage of polarization at similar total flux levels and this could be due
either to changing non-axisymmetry in the optical continuum emission, or a
change in the number of scatterers on a timescale of years.

"  A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to study the propagation
of soundwaves in a fluid. Soundwaves are generated by a sinusoidally
oscillating wall and annihilated by a locally applied Langevin thermostat near
the opposite wall. The waveform changes from sinusoidal to sawtooth with
increasing wave amplitude. For low-frequency sounds, the simulation results
show very good agreement with Burgers equation without any fitting parameters.
In contrast, for highfrequency sounds, significant deviations are obtained
because of acoustic streaming. The speed of sound can be directly determined
from the Fourier transform of a waveform with high accuracy. Although obtaining
the attenuation rate directly from the simulation results is difficult because
of the nonlinear effects of the wave amplitude, it can be estimated via Burgers
equation. The results demonstrate that MD simulations are a useful tool for the
quantitative analysis of soundwaves.

"  Machine-learned models for author profiling in social media often rely on

"  While the dynamics of polymer chains in equilibrium media is well understood
by now, the polymer dynamics in active non-equilibrium environments can be very
different. Here we study the dynamics of polymers in a viscous medium
containing self-propelled particles in two dimensions by using Brownian
dynamics simulations. We find that the polymer center of mass exhibits a
superdiffusive motion at short to intermediate times and the motion turns
normal at long times, but with a greatly enhanced diffusivity. Interestingly,
the long time diffusivity shows a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the
chain length and stiffness. We analyze how the polymer conformation and the
accumulation of the self-propelled particles, and therefore the directed motion
of the polymer, are correlated. At the point of maximal polymer diffusivity,
the polymer has preferentially bent conformations maintained by the balance
between the chain elasticity and the propelling force generated by the active
particles. We also consider the barrier crossing dynamics of actively-driven
polymers in a double-well potential. The barrier crossing times are
demonstrated to have a peculiar non-monotonic dependence, related to that of
the diffusivity. This effect can be potentially utilized for sorting of
polymers from solutions in \textit{in vitro} experiments.

the generation of theoretical cyclotron spectra. For lower field models, a
cylindrical geometry of the line forming region and the strong angle dependence

two phase coexistence and Z method determinations of the melting line of solid

about 100 K, and hint at a possible secondary maximum in the melting line in
the region between 500 and 600 GPa, testifying to the importance of quantum

idea is to nonparametrically transfer summary structures from annotated videos
to unseen test videos. We show how to extend our method to exploit semantic
side information about the video's category/genre to guide the transfer process
by those training videos semantically consistent with the test input. We also
show how to generalize our method to subshot-based summarization, which not
only reduces computational costs but also provides more flexible ways of
defining visual similarity across subshots spanning several frames. We conduct
extensive evaluation on several benchmarks and demonstrate promising results,
outperforming existing methods in several settings.

"  We devised a straightforward procedure to derive the atmosphere fundamental
parameters of stars across the different MK spectral types by comparing
mid-resolution spectroscopic observations with theoretical grids of synthetic
spectra.The results of a preliminary experiment, by matching the Gunn and
Stryker and Jacoby et al. spectrophotometric atlases with the Kurucz models,
are briefly discussed. For stars in the A-K spectral range, effective
temperature is obtained within a 1-2% relative uncertainty (at 2 sigma
confidence level). This value raises to 4-5% for the hottest stars in the
samples (O-B spectral types). A poorer fit is obtained throughout for stars
cooler than 4000 K mainly due to the limiting input physics in the Kurucz

"  We report on the electronic ground state of a layered perovskite vanadium
oxide Sr$_2$VO$_4$ studied by the combined use of synchrotron radiation x-ray
diffraction (SR-XRD) and muon spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) techniques,
where $\mu$SR measurements were extended down to 30 mK. We found an
intermediate orthorhombic phase between $T_{\rm c2} \sim$~130 K and $T_{\rm c1}
\sim$~100 K, whereas a tetragonal phase appears for $T > T_{\rm c2}$ and $T <
T_{\rm c1}$. The absence of long-range magnetic order was confirmed by $\mu$SR
at the reentrant tetragonal phase below $T_{\rm c1}$, where the relative
enhancement in the $c$-axis length versus that of the $a$-axis length was
observed. However, no clear indication of the lowering of the tetragonal
lattice symmetry with superlattice modulation, which is expected in the orbital
order state with superstructure of $d_{yz}$ and $d_{zx}$ orbitals, was observed
by SR-XRD below $T_{\rm c1}$. Instead, it was inferred from $\mu$SR that a
magnetic state developed below $T_{\rm c0} \sim$~10 K, which was characterized
by the highly inhomogeneous and fluctuating local magnetic fields down to 30
mK. We argue that the anomalous magnetic ground state below $T_{\rm c0}$
originates from the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic

"  To generate initial conditions for cosmological $N$-body simulations, one
needs to prepare a uniform distribution of simulation particles, so-called the
pre-initial condition (pre-IC). The standard method to construct the pre-IC is
to place the particles on the lattice grids evenly spaced in the
three-dimensional spatial coordinates. However, even after the initial
displacement of each particle according to cosmological perturbations, the
particle distribution remains to display an artificial anisotropy. Such an
artifact causes systematic effects in simulations at later time until the
evolved particle distribution sufficiently erases the initial anisotropy. In
this paper, we study the impacts of the pre-IC on the anisotropic separate
universe simulation, where the effect of large-scale tidal field on structure
formation is taken into account using the anisotropic expansion in a local
background (simulation volume). To quantify the impacts, we compare the
simulations employing the standard grid pre-IC and the glass one, where the
latter is supposed to suppress the initial anisotropy. We show that the
artificial features in the grid pre-IC simulations are seen until $z\sim 9$,
while the glass pre-IC simulations appear to be stable and accurate over the
range of scales we study. From these results we find that a coupling of the
large-scale tidal field with matter clustering is enhanced compared to the
leading-order prediction of perturbation theory in the quasi non-linear regime
in the redshift range $5\lesssim z\lesssim 15$, indicating the importance of
tidal field on structure formation at such high redshifts, e.g. during the
epoch of reionization.

"  SubHalo Abundance Matching (SHAM) is an empirical method for constructing
galaxy catalogues based on high-resolution $N$-body simulations. We apply SHAM
on the UNIT simulation to simulate SDSS BOSS/eBOSS Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs)
within a wide redshift range of $0.2 < z < 1.0$. Besides the typical SHAM
scatter parameter $\sigma$, we include $v_{\rm smear}$ and $V_{\rm ceil}$ to
take into account the redshift uncertainty and the galaxy incompleteness
respectively. These two additional parameters are critical for reproducing the
observed 2PCF multipoles on 5--25$\,h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$. The redshift
uncertainties obtained from the best-fitting $v_{\rm smear}$ agree with those
measured from repeat observations for all SDSS LRGs except for the LOWZ sample.
We explore several potential systematics but none of them can explain the
discrepancy found in LOWZ. Our explanation is that the LOWZ galaxies might
contain another type of galaxies which needs to be treated differently. The
evolution of the measured $\sigma$ and $V_{\rm ceil}$ also reveals that the
incompleteness of eBOSS galaxies decreases with the redshift. This is the
consequence of the magnitude lower limit applied in eBOSS LRG target selection.
Our SHAM also set upper limits for the intrinsic scatter of the galaxy--halo
relation given a complete galaxy sample: $\sigma_{\rm int}<0.31$ for LOWZ at
$0.2<z<0.33$, $\sigma_{\rm int}<0.36$ for LOWZ at $0.33<z<0.43$, and

"  We present a new measurement of the scaling relation between X-ray luminosity
and total mass for 17,000 galaxy clusters in the maxBCG cluster sample.
Stacking sub-samples within fixed ranges of optical richness, N_200, we measure
the mean 0.1-2.4 keV X-ray luminosity, <L_X>, from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey.
The mean mass, <M_200>, is measured from weak gravitational lensing of SDSS
background galaxies (Johnston et al. 2007). For 9 <= N_200 < 200, the data are
well fit by a power-law, <L_X>/10^42 h^-2 erg/s = (12.6+1.4-1.3 (stat) +/- 1.6
(sys)) (<M_200>/10^14 h^-1 M_sun)^1.65+/-0.13. The slope agrees to within 10%
with previous estimates based on X-ray selected catalogs, implying that the
covariance in L_X and N_200 at fixed halo mass is not large. The luminosity
intercent is 30%, or 2\sigma, lower than determined from the X-ray flux-limited
sample of Reiprich & Bohringer (2002), assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. This
difference could arise from a combination of Malmquist bias and/or systematic
error in hydrostatic mass estimates, both of which are expected. The intercept
agrees with that derived by Stanek et al. (2006) using a model for the

"  Theoretical studies on charge ordering phenomena in quarter-filled molecular
(organic) conductors are reviewed. Extended Hubbard models including not only
the on-site but also the inter-site Coulomb repulsion are constructed in a
straightforward way from the crystal structures, which serve for individual
study on each material as well as for their systematic understandings. In
general the inter-site Coulomb interaction stabilizes Wigner crystal-type
charge ordered states, where the charge localizes in an arranged manner
avoiding each other, and can drive the system insulating. The variety in the
lattice structures, represented by anisotropic networks in not only the
electron hopping but also in the inter-site Coulomb repulsion, brings about
diverse problems in low-dimensional strongly correlated systems. Competitions
and/or co-existences between the charge ordered state and other states are
discussed, such as metal, superconductor, and the dimer-type Mott insulating
state which is another typical insulating state in molecular conductors.
Interplay with magnetism, e.g., antiferromagnetic state and spin gapped state
for example due to the spin-Peierls transition, is considered as well. Distinct
situations are pointed out: influences of the coupling to the lattice degree of

"  This paper introduces a new online learning framework for multiclass
classification called learning with diluted bandit feedback. At every time
step, the algorithm predicts a candidate label set instead of a single label
for the observed example. It then receives feedback from the environment
whether the actual label lies in this candidate label set or not. This feedback
is called ""diluted bandit feedback"". Learning in this setting is even more
challenging than the bandit feedback setting, as there is more uncertainty in
the supervision. We propose an algorithm for multiclass classification using
dilute bandit feedback (MC-DBF), which uses the exploration-exploitation
strategy to predict the candidate set in each trial. We show that the proposed
algorithm achieves O(T^{1-\frac{1}{m+2}}) mistake bound if candidate label set
size (in each step) is m. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach with extensive simulations.

"  In the faint star KIC 9700322 observed by the Kepler satellite, 76
frequencies with amplitudes from 14 to 29000 ppm were detected. The two
dominant frequencies at 9.79 and 12.57 c/d (113.3 and 145.5 \mu Hz),
interpreted to be radial modes, are accompanied by a large number of
combination frequencies. A small additional modulation with a 0.16 c/d
frequency is also seen; this is interpreted to be the rotation frequency of the
star. The corresponding prediction of slow rotation is confirmed by a spectrum
from which v sin i = 19 \pm 1 km/s is obtained. The analysis of the spectrum
shows that the star is one of the coolest {\delta} Sct variables. We also
determine Teff = 6700 \pm 100 K and log g = 3.7 \pm 0.1, compatible with the
observed frequencies of the radial modes. Normal solar abundances are found. An
\ell = 2 frequency quintuplet is also detected with a frequency separation
consistent with predictions from the measured rotation rate. A remarkable
result is the absence of additional independent frequencies down to an
amplitude limit near 14 ppm, suggesting that the star is stable against most
forms of nonradial pulsation. The frequency spectrum of this star emphasizes
the need for caution in interpreting low frequencies in {\delta} Sct stars as
independent gravity modes. A low frequency peak at 2.7763 c/d in KIC 9700322
is, in fact, the frequency difference between the two dominant modes and is
repeated over and over in various frequency combinations involving the two
dominant modes. The relative phases of the combination frequencies show a
strong correlation with frequency, but the physical significance of this result

"  Modern retrospective analytics systems leverage cascade architecture to
mitigate bottleneck for computing deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the
existing cascades suffer two limitations: (1) decoding bottleneck is either
neglected or circumvented, paying significant compute and storage cost for

lack spatial query support. This paper presents CoVA, a novel cascade
architecture that splits the cascade computation between compressed domain and
pixel domain to address the decoding bottleneck, supporting both temporal and
spatial queries. CoVA cascades analysis into three major stages where the first
two stages are performed in compressed domain while the last one in pixel
domain. First, CoVA detects occurrences of moving objects (called blobs) over a
set of compressed frames (called tracks). Then, using the track results, CoVA
prudently selects a minimal set of frames to obtain the label information and
only decode them to compute the full DNNs, alleviating the decoding bottleneck.
Lastly, CoVA associates tracks with labels to produce the final analysis
results on which users can process both temporal and spatial queries. Our
experiments demonstrate that CoVA offers 4.8x throughput improvement over
modern cascade systems, while imposing modest accuracy loss.

is necessary for approximation, and the distribution-free model is preferred
when there is little information on the demand distribution and how demand
reacts to the pricing decision. Moreover, the proposed model and algorithm are

"  We present a novel approach for characterizing the properties and performance
of active matter in dilute suspension as well as in crowded environments. We
use Super-Heterodyne Laser-Doppler-Velocimetry (SH-LDV) to study large
ensembles of catalytically active Janus particles moving under UV-illumination.
SH-LDV facilitates a model-free determination of the swimming speed and
direction, with excellent ensemble averaging. In addition we obtain
in-formation on the distribution of the catalytic activity. Moreover, SH-LDV
operates away from walls and permits a facile correction for multiple
scattering contributions. It thus allows for stud-ies of concentrated
suspensions of swimmers or of systems where swimmers propel actively in an
environment crowded by passive particles. We demonstrate the versatility and
the scope of the method with a few selected examples. We anticipate that SH-LDV
complements estab-lished methods and paves the way for systematic measurements
at previously inaccessible boundary conditions.

was included in the joint paper [Digne-Gomi, Presentation of pure braid groups,
J. Knot Theory and its Ramifications 10 (2001) 609--623]. Sections 2 and 6 were

subjected to fractionalization, transforming themselves into two closely spaced
$\pi-$kinks. As they propagate in the array along with the single $\pi-$kink or
the $\pi-$kink - $\pi-$antikink pair, they give rise to higher half-integer or

$\mathrm {Riem}(g)\in (0, \binom{n}{2}]$ is defined to be the infinimum over

curvature operator of $g$ and $\lambda_{\rm max}$ is the maximal eigenvalue.
The functional $g\to \mathrm {Riem}(g)$ is continuous, re-scale invariant and

"  We present a method for calculation of Raman modes of the quantum solid phase
I solid hydrogen and deuterium. We use the mean-field assumption that the
quantised excitations are localized on one molecule. This is done by explicit
solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation in an angle-dependent
potential, and direct calculation of the polarisation. We show that in the
free-rotor limit, the H$_2$ and D$_2$ frequencies differ by a factor of 2,
which evolves toward $\sqrt{2}$ as the modes acquire librational character due
to stronger interactions. The ratio overshoots $\sqrt{2}$ if anharmonic terms
weaken the harmonic potential. We also use density functional theory and
molecular dynamics to calculate the E$_{2_g}$ optical phonon frequency and the
Raman linewidths. The molecular dynamics shows that the molecules are not free
rotors except at very low pressure and high temperature, and become like
oscillators as phase II is approached. We fit the interaction strengths to
experimental frequencies, but good agreement for intensities requires us to
also include strong preferred-orientation and stimulated Raman effects between
S$_0$(1) and S$_0$(0) contributions. The experimental Raman spectrum for phase
II cannot be reproduced, showing that the mean-field assumption is invalid in

"  Aims. To produce an homogeneous catalog of astrophysical parameters of 239
resolved star clusters located in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds,

  Methods. The cluster sample was processed with the recently introduced
Automated Stellar Cluster Analysis ($\texttt{ASteCA}$) package, which ensures
both an automatized and a fully reproducible treatment, together with a
statistically based analysis of their fundamental parameters and associated
uncertainties. The fundamental parameters determined with this tool for each
cluster, via a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) analysis, are: metallicity, age,
reddening, distance modulus, and total mass.
  Results. We generated an homogeneous catalog of structural and fundamental
parameters for the studied cluster sample, and performed a detailed internal
error analysis along with a thorough comparison with values taken from
twenty-six published articles. We studied the distribution of cluster
fundamental parameters in both Clouds, and obtained their age-metallicity

  Conclusions. The $\texttt{ASteCA}$ package can be applied to an unsupervised
determination of fundamental cluster parameters; a task of increasing relevance
as more data becomes available through upcoming surveys.

"  The direct muon transfer from protium to neon at low collision energies is
considered. The question is discussed how the energy dependence of the transfer
rate can be extracted from available experimental data. A model is suggested
which is based on two assumptions. First, the muon transfer occurs within an
interaction sphere out of which the entrance and transfer channels are not
coupled. Secondly, for the s- and p-waves at low collision energies, the
complex logarithmic derivatives of the radial wave functions of the entrance
channel on the interaction sphere are energy-independent. With only the s-wave
taken into account, two values of the logarithmic derivative were found, which
agree with the transfer rates measured at the temperatures of 20 and 300 K.
Within this temperature interval, the rates evaluated for these two values
differ only slightly. Noticeable differences arise at temperatures of a few
kelvins. The choice of the preferred value of the logarithmic derivative was
made by the comparison of the energy dependence of the S-matrix with results of
previous calculations. Thereby, the proposed procedure may be a way to correct
calculations at low collision energies.

particular to describe the atomic modulations with respect to their ideal
positions, shown here to strongly affect the electronic structure of the

is found to be primarily sensitive to the choice of pseudopotential and
exchange-correlation function, while almost completely insensitive to the

"  Online auctions are one of the most fundamental facets of the modern economy
and power an industry generating hundreds of billions of dollars a year in
revenue. Auction theory has historically focused on the question of designing
the best way to sell a single item to potential buyers, with the concurrent
objectives of maximizing revenue generated or welfare created. Theoretical
results in this area have typically relied on some prior Bayesian knowledge
agents were assumed to have on each-other. This assumption is no longer
satisfied in new markets such as online advertising: similar items are sold
repeatedly, and agents are unaware of each other or might try to manipulate
each-other. On the other hand, statistical learning theory now provides tools
to supplement those missing pieces of information given enough data, as agents
can learn from their environment to improve their strategies. This survey
covers recent advances in learning in repeated auctions, starting from the
traditional economic study of optimal one-shot auctions with a Bayesian prior.
We then focus on the question of learning optimal mechanisms from a dataset of
bidders' past values. The sample complexity as well as the computational
efficiency of different methods will be studied. We will also investigate
online variants where gathering data has a cost to be accounted for, either by
seller or buyers (""earning while learning""). Later in the survey, we will
further assume that bidders are also adaptive to the mechanism as they interact
repeatedly with the same seller. We will show how strategic agents can actually
manipulate repeated auctions, to their own advantage. All the questions
discussed in this survey are grounded in real-world applications and many of
the ideas and algorithms we describe are used every day to power the Internet

"  Understanding the formation of the first stars is one of the frontier topics
in modern astrophysics and cosmology. Their emergence signaled the end of the
cosmic dark ages, a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, leading to a
fundamental transformation of the early Universe through the production of
ionizing photons and the initial enrichment with heavy chemical elements. We
here review the state of our knowledge, separating the well understood elements
of our emerging picture from those where more work is required. Primordial star
formation is unique in that its initial conditions can be directly inferred
from the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model of cosmological structure
formation. Combined with gas cooling that is mediated via molecular hydrogen,
one can robustly identify the regions of primordial star formation, the
so-called minihalos, having total masses of ~10^6 M_sun and collapsing at
redshifts z~20-30. Within this framework, a number of studies have defined a
preliminary standard model, with the main result that the first stars were
predominantly massive. This model has recently been modified to include a
ubiquitous mode of fragmentation in the protostellar disks, such that the
typical outcome of primordial star formation may be the formation of a binary
or small multiple stellar system. We will also discuss extensions to this
standard picture due to the presence of dynamically significant magnetic
fields, of heating from self-annihalating WIMP dark matter, or cosmic rays. We

"  Rapid inflows associated with early galaxy formation lead to the accumulation
of self-gravitating gas in the centers of proto-galaxies. Such gas
accumulations are prone to non-axisymmetric instabilities, as in the well-known
Maclaurin sequence of rotating ellipsoids, which are accompanied by a
catastrophic loss of angular momentum (J). Self-gravitating gas is also
intuitively associated with star formation. However, recent simulations of the
infall process display highly turbulent continuous flows. We propose that
J-transfer, which enables the inflow, also suppresses fragmentation.
Inefficient J loss by the gas leads to decay of turbulence, triggering global
instabilities and renewed turbulence driving. Flow regulated in this way is
stable against fragmentation, whilst staying close to the instability threshold
for bar formation -- thick self-gravitating disks are prone to global
instabilities before they become unstable locally. On smaller scales, the
fraction of gravitationally unstable matter swept up by shocks in such a flow
is a small and decreasing function of the Mach number. We conclude
counterintuitively that gas able to cool down to a small fraction of its virial
temperature will not fragment as it collapses. This provides a venue for
supermassive black holes to form via direct infall, without the intermediary
stage of forming a star cluster. Some black holes could have formed or grown in
massive halos at low redshifts. Thus the fragmentation is intimately related to
J redistribution within the system: it is less dependent on the molecular and
metal cooling but is conditioned by the ability of the flow to develop virial,
supersonic turbulence.

"  Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer observations of the
supernova remnant 1E0102.2-7219 in the Small Magellanic Cloud reveal a spectrum
dominated by X-ray emission lines from hydrogen-like and helium-like ions of
oxygen, neon, magnesium and silicon, with little iron. The dispersed spectrum
shows a series of monochromatic images of the source in the light of individual
spectral lines. Detailed examination of these dispersed images reveals Doppler
shifts within the supernova remnant, indicating bulk matter velocities on the
order of 1000 km/s. These bulk velocities suggest an expanding ring-like
structure with additional substructure, inclined to the line of sight. A
two-dimensional spatial/velocity map of the SNR shows a striking spatial
separation of redshifted and blueshifted regions, and indicates a need for
further investigation before an adequate 3D model can be found. The radii of
the ring-like images of the dispersed spectrum vary with ionization stage,
supporting an interpretation of progressive ionization due to passage of the
reverse shock through the ejecta. Plasma diagnostics with individual emission
lines of oxygen are consistent with an ionizing plasma in the low density
limit, and provide temperature and ionization constraints on the plasma.
Assuming a pure metal plasma, the mass of oxygen is estimated at ~6 solar
masses, consistent with a massive progenitor.

"  In the present study, numerical investigations were performed with
optimisation to determine efficient non-uniform suction profiles to control the
flow around a circular cylinder in the range of Reynolds numbers 4<Re<188.5.
Several objectives were explored, namely the minimisation of: the separation
angle, total drag, and the pressure drag. This was in an effort to determine
the relationships between the characteristics of the uncontrolled flow and the
parameters of optimised suction control. A variety of non-uniform suction
configurations were implemented and compared to the benchmark performance of
uniform suction. It was determined that the best non-uniform suction profiles
consisted of a distribution with a single locus and compact support. The centre
of suction on the cylinder surface for the optimised control, and the quantity
of suction necessary to achieve each objective, varied substantially with
Reynolds number and also with the separation angle of the uncontrolled flows.
These followed predictable relationships, however. Non-uniform suction profiles
were much more efficient at eliminating boundary layer separation, requiring
the removal of less than half the volume of fluid as uniform control to achieve
the same objective. Regardless of the method of control, less net suction was
needed to minimise total drag than to eliminate separation. Though boundary
layer separation could always be prevented, its elimination did not always
result in an improvement in total drag, and in some circumstances increased it.

For aligned rotators we confirm the ``disk-dome'' charge-separated structure of

"  Orion's veil consists of several layers of largely neutral gas lying between

absorption and in optical and UV absorption lines of H I and other species.
Toward the Trapezium, the veil has two remarkable properties, high magnetic
field (~100 microGauss) and a surprising lack of molecular hydrogen given its
total hydrogen column density. Here we compute photoionization models of the
veil to establish its gas density and its distance from the Trapezium. We use a
greatly improved model of the hydrogen molecule that determines level
populations in ~1e5 rotational/vibrational levels and provides improved
estimates of molecular hydrogen destruction via the Lyman-Werner bands. Our
best fit photoionization models place the veil 1-3 pc in front of the star at a
density of 1e3-1e4 cubic centimeters. Magnetic energy dominates the energy of
non-thermal motions in at least one of the 21cm H I velocity components.
Therefore, the veil is the first interstellar environment where magnetic
dominance appears to exist. We find that the low ratio of molecular to atomic
hydrogen (< 1e-4) is a consequence of high UV flux incident upon the veil due
to its proximity to the Trapezium stars and the absence of small grains in the

"  For decades, scientists have tried to explain the evidence for fluvial
activity on early Mars, but a consensus has yet to emerge regarding the
mechanism for producing it. One hypothesis suggests early Mars was warmed by a
thick greenhouse atmosphere. Another suggests that early Mars was generally
cold but was warmed occasionally by impacts or by episodes of enhanced
volcanism. These latter hypotheses struggle to produce the amounts of rainfall
needed to form the martian valleys, but are consistent with inferred low rates
of weathering compared to Earth. Here, we provide a geophysical mechanism that
could have induced cycles of glaciation and deglaciation on early Mars. Our
model produces dramatic climate cycles with extended periods of glaciation
punctuated by warm periods lasting up to 10 Myr, much longer than those
generated in other episodic warming models. The cycles occur because stellar
insolation was low, and because CO2 outgassing is not able to keep pace with
CO2 consumption by silicate weathering followed by deposition of carbonates.
While CO2 by itself is not able to deglaciate early Mars in our model, we
assume that the greenhouse effect is enhanced by substantial amounts of H2
outgassed from Mars' reduced crust and mantle. Our hypothesis can be tested by
future Mars exploration that better establishes the time scale for valley
formation.

"  The goal of domain adaptation is to adapt models learned on a source domain
to a particular target domain. Most methods for unsupervised domain adaptation
proposed in the literature to date, assume that the set of classes present in
the target domain is identical to the set of classes present in the source
domain. This is a restrictive assumption that limits the practical
applicability of unsupervised domain adaptation techniques in real world
settings (""in the wild""). Therefore, we relax this constraint and propose a
technique that allows the set of target classes to be a subset of the source
classes. This way, large publicly available annotated datasets with a wide
variety of classes can be used as source, even if the actual set of classes in
target can be more limited and, maybe most importantly, unknown beforehand.
  To this end, we propose an algorithm that orders a set of source subspaces
that are relevant to the target classification problem. Our method then chooses
a restricted set from this ordered set of source subspaces. As an extension,
even starting from multiple source datasets with varied sets of categories,
this method automatically selects an appropriate subset of source categories
relevant to a target dataset. Empirical analysis on a number of source and
target domain datasets shows that restricting the source subspace to only a
subset of categories does indeed substantially improve the eventual target
classification accuracy over the baseline that considers all source classes.

planet's atmosphere at >8$\sigma$, which could contribute to (or even fully
explain) the temperature inversion in the stratosphere. However, using standard
cross-correlation methods, it is difficult to extract physical parameters such
as temperature and abundances. Recent pioneering efforts have sought to develop
likelihood `mappings' that can be used to directly fit models to
high-resolution datasets. We introduce a new framework that directly computes
the likelihood of the model fit to the data, and can be used to explore the
posterior distribution of parameterised model atmospheres via MCMC techniques.
Our method also recovers the physical extent of the atmosphere, as well as
account for time- and wavelength-dependent uncertainties. We measure a
temperature of $3710^{+490}_{-510}$K, indicating a higher temperature in the
upper atmosphere when compared to low-resolution observations. We also show
that the Fe I signal is physically separated from the exospheric Fe II.
However, the temperature measurements are highly degenerate with aerosol
properties; detection of additional species, using more sophisticated
atmospheric models, or combining these methods with low-resolution spectra
should help break these degeneracies.

"  We numerically calculate the magnetization by applying the magnetic field
($B$) perpendicular to two-dimensional corbino disk system without electron
spin. We obtain that the period of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations of
magnetization $[M(B)]$ exhibit $\phi_0$, $\phi_0/2$ and almost $\phi_0/3$ as a
function of $\phi$, depending on numbers of electrons ($N$), where
$\phi_0=\frac{hc}{e}$ is a unit flux and $\phi$ is the magnetic flux through
the hollow of the disk. The oscillations of $M(B)$ are classified into five
patterns at $1\leq N\leq 27$ investigated in this study. These are expected to
be observed in the two-dimensional semiconductor corbino disk with the hollow

"  We have performed cosmo-hydro simulations using the RAMSES code to study
atomic cooling (ACHs) haloes at z=10 with masses 5E7Msun<~M<~2E9Msun. We assume
primordial gas and H2-cooling and prior star-formation have been suppressed. We
analysed 19 haloes (gas and DM) at a resolution of ~10 (proper) pc, selected
from a total volume of ~2E3 (comoving) Mpc3. This is the largest statistical
hydro-sim. study of ACHs at z>10 to date. We examine the morphology, angular
momentum (AM), thermodynamic, and turbulence of these haloes, in order to
assess the prevalence of disks and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We find no
correlation between either the magnitude or the direction of the AM of the gas
and its parent DM halo. Only 3 haloes form rotationally supported cores. Two of
the most massive haloes form massive, compact overdense blobs. These blobs have
an accretion rate ~0.5 Msun/yr (at a distance of 100 pc), and are possible
sites of SMBH formation. Our results suggest that the degree of rotational
support and the fate of the gas in a halo is determined by its large-scale
environment and merger history. In particular, the two haloes forming blobs are
located at knots of the cosmic web, cooled early on, and experienced many
mergers. The gas in these haloes is lumpy and highly turbulent, with Mach N. >~
5. In contrast, the haloes forming rotationally supported cores are relatively
more isolated, located midway along filaments, cooled more recently, and
underwent fewer mergers. Thus, the gas in these haloes is less lumpy and less
turbulent (Mach <~ 4), and could retain most of its AM. The remaining 14 haloes
have intermediate properties. If verified in a larger sample of haloes and with
additional physics, our results will have implications for observations of the
highest-redshift galaxies and quasars with JWST.

the amplifications of Alfven waves generated by the escaping CR particles and
their effects on CR escape into interstellar medium (ISM). We find that the
amplification of the waves significantly delays the escape of the particles

energy spectrum of CR particles measured through gamma-ray observations at
molecular clouds around SNRs is seriously affected by the particle scattering

"  Traditionally, graph algorithms get a single graph as input, and then they
should decide if this graph satisfies a certain property $\Phi$. What happens
if this question is modified in a way that we get a possibly infinite family of
graphs as an input, and the question is if there is a graph satisfying $\Phi$
in the family? We approach this question by using formal languages for
specifying families of graphs, in particular by regular sets of words. We show
that certain graph properties can be decided by studying the syntactic monoid
of the specification language $L$ if a certain torsion condition is satisfied.
This condition holds trivially if $L$ is regular. More specifically, we use a
natural binary encoding of finite graphs over a binary alphabet $\Sigma$, and
we define a regular set $\mathbb{G}\subseteq \Sigma^*$ such that every nonempty
word $w\in \mathbb{G}$ defines a finite and nonempty graph. Also, graph
properties can then be syntactically defined as languages over $\Sigma$. Then,
we ask whether the automaton $\mathcal{A}$ specifies some graph satisfying a
certain property~$\Phi$. Our structural results show that we can answer this
question for all ""typical"" graph properties.
  In order to show our results, we split $L$ into a finite union of subsets and
every subset of this union defines in a natural way a single finite graph $F$
where some edges and vertices are marked. The marked graph in turn defines an
infinite graph $F^\infty$ and therefore the family of finite subgraphs of
$F^\infty$ where $F$ appears as an induced subgraph. This yields a geometric
description of all graphs specified by $L$ based on splitting $L$ into finitely
many pieces; then using the notion of graph retraction, we obtain an easily
understandable description of the graphs in each piece.

"  Few-shot learning aims to classify unseen classes with only a limited number
of labeled data. Recent works have demonstrated that training models with a
simple transfer learning strategy can achieve competitive results in few-shot
classification. Although excelling at distinguishing training data, these
models are not well generalized to unseen data, probably due to insufficient
feature representations on evaluation. To tackle this issue, we propose
Semantically Proportional Patchmix (SePPMix), in which patches are cut and
pasted among training images and the ground truth labels are mixed
proportionally to the semantic information of the patches. In this way, we can
improve the generalization ability of the model by regional dropout effect
without introducing severe label noise. To learn more robust representations of

rotations as a rule-based regularizer. Extensive experiments on prevalent
few-shot benchmarks have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method.

belonging to the blazar class that lie within the positional uncertainty region
of the UGSs and thus could be their potential low-energy counterparts. To
achieve our aims, we first adopted several procedures based on the peculiar
observational properties of blazars in the radio and in the IR. Then we carried
out a follow-up spectroscopic campaign in the optical band to verify the nature
of the candidates selected as potential counterparts of the UGSs. Here we
present the results of the observations carried out in 2013 in the Northern
Hemisphere at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO). Optical spectroscopy is
crucial to confirm the nature of the sources and can be used to estimate their
redshifts; it will also allow us to test the robustness of our methods when the
whole campaign is completed. Here we present the optical spectroscopic
observations of 39 sources. Within our sample we found that 6 sources are
blazars, candidates to be low-energy counterparts of the UGSs listed in the
2FGL. We confirm that an additional 8 sources, previously classified as active
galaxies of uncertain type and associated in the 2FGL, are also all BL Lac
objects. Moreover, we also present 20 new spectra for known blazars listed in
the Multi-frequency Catalogue of Blazars as having an uncertain redshift and/or

galaxies through feeding and feedback processes. A spatially resolved
multiwavelength survey is required to map the interaction of AGN with their
host galaxies on different spatial scales and different phases of the ISM. The
goal of CARS is to obtain the necessary spatially resolved multiwavelength
observations for an unbiased sample of local unobscured luminous AGN. We
present the overall CARS survey design and the associated wide-field optical
IFU spectroscopy for all 41 CARS targets at z<0.06 randomly selected from the
Hamburg/ESO survey of luminous unobscured AGN. This data set provides the
backbone of CARS and allows us to characterize host galaxy morphologies, AGN
parameters, precise systemic redshifts, and ionized gas distributions including
excitation conditions, kinematics, and metallicities in unprecedented detail.
We focus our study on the size of the ENLR which has been traditionally
connected to AGN luminosity. Given the large scatter in the ENLR
size-luminosity relation, we performed a large parameter search to identify
potentially more fundamental relations. Remarkably, we identified the strongest
correlation between the maximum projected ENLR size and the black hole mass,
consistent with an $R_\mathrm{ENLR,max}\sim M_\mathrm{BH}^{0.5}$ relationship.
We interpret the maximum ENLR size as a timescale indicator of a single BH
radiative-efficient accretion episode for which we inferred log(t_AGN) =
(0.45+- 0.08)log(M_BH)+1.78 using forward modeling. The extrapolation of our
inferred relation toward higher BH masses is consistent with an independent
lifetime estimate from the HeII proximity zones around luminous AGN at z~3.
While our proposed link between the BH mass and AGN lifetime might be a
secondary correlation itself or impacted by unknown biases, it has a few
relevant implications if confirmed.

curve analyses of a rapidly-declining sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernova
KSP-OT-201509b (= AT2015cx) from the KMTNet Supernova Program. The Phillips

$\pm$ 0.12 $M_{\odot}$ of ejecta mass and (0.61 $\pm$ 0.14) $\times$ 10$^{51}$

synchronously with the changes in the $I$-band light curve as found in other
supernovae, we also find the presence of an early redward evolution in $V-I$
prior to --10 days since peak. The bolometric light curve of the source is
compatible with a stratified $^{56}$Ni distribution extended to shallow layers
of the exploding progenitor. Comparisons between the observed light curves and
those predicted from ejecta-companion interactions clearly disfavor Roche
Lobe-filling companion stars at large separation distances, thus supporting a
double-degenerate scenario for its origin. The lack of any apparent host galaxy

"  The design of urban areas and building that utilizes the microclimatic
effects of trees is a promising approach for reducing the severe heat stress
caused by urban heat islands and global warming. Although trees can reduce heat
stress through solar shading during the daytime, their influence on the air
temperature under and around them during the nighttime, which is important for
nighttime thermal comfort, has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we
investigated the nocturnal cooling effect of trees in a physical urban space by
the coupled numerical simulation of longwave radiative transfer and
computational fluid dynamics. To represent the spatial structure of an actual
urban space, airborne LiDAR-derived three-dimensional data of leaf area density
distribution and building shape were used. The species-specific convective heat
transfer coefficient was also considered. An analysis of the calculated
sensible heat flux shows that both leaf area density and sky view factor are
important factors in the production of cool air. According to the calculated
distributions of air temperature and velocity, even under the condition of a
certain degree of incident flow, the cooled air can flow down to the space
under the crown, accumulate, and then diverge when the wind speed is
sufficiently low in the crown owing to the crown drag. Buildings contribute to
both the accumulation and dissipation of cool air. The findings of the present
study suggest that cool spots can be produced during nighttime by trees planted
near streets by devising a suitable arrangement and morphology of trees and
buildings.

dust grains in protoplanetary discs whose surface density and temperature
follow power-law profiles, with exponent p and q respectively. We investigate
both the Epstein and the Stokes drag regimes which govern the motion of the

observed discs, we predict the fate of dust grains in real discs. Results. When
a dust grain reaches the inner regions of the disc, the acceleration due to the
increase of the pressure gradient is counterbalanced by the increase of the gas
drag. We find that most grains in the Epstein (resp. the Stokes) regime survive
their radial migration if-p+q+1/2 \leq0 (resp. if q\leq 2/3). The majority of
observed discs satisfies both-p+q+ 1/2 \leq0 and q\leq 2/3: a large fraction of

"  RESTful APIs are an increasingly common way to expose software systems

This paper introduces a method to explore the behaviour of a RESTful API. This
is done by using automatic property-based tests produced from OpenAPI documents
that describe the REST API under test. We describe how this method creates
artifacts that can be leveraged both as property-based test generators and as a
source of validation for results (i.e., as test oracles). Experimental results,
on both industrial and open source services, indicate how this approach is a
low effort way of finding real faults. Furthermore, it supports building
additional knowledge about the system under test by automatically exposing
misalignment of specification and implementation. Since the tests are generated
from the OpenAPI document this method automatically evolves test cases as the
REST API evolves.

"  Luminosity of GRB 170817A is much lower than that of other sGRBs. The
measurement of the superluminal movement of the radio afterglow emission
confirms the presence of the relativistic jet, and the emission features can be
well explained by the structured jet model. In this paper, we calculate the
luminosity distribution of sGRBs and its evolution with redshift based on the
structured (Gaussian) jet model, and find that the typical luminosity increase
with redshift, for nearby sGRBs (such as for luminosity distance less than 200
Mpc) the typical gamma-ray luminosity is just around 10^47-10^48 erg s-1, which
naturally explains the very low radiation luminosity of GRB 170817A. We derived
the detection probability of sGRBs by Fermi-GBM and found that the expected
detection rate of sGRBs is only about 1 yr-1 within the distance of several
hundred Mpc. We explored the effect of the power-law index {\alpha} of the
merger time distribution on the observed characteristics and found that it had
little effect on the observed luminosity and viewing-angle distributions.
However, it is very interesting that, for different values of {\alpha}, the
distributions of the number of observed sGRBs are quite different, so it is
possible to determine the value of {\alpha} through observed distributions of
the number of sGRBs. We used the Bayesian method to make a quantitative
analysis and found that the value of {\alpha} may be identified when the number
of observed sGRBs with known redshifts is more than 200. Finally, we compare
our results of gamma-ray luminosity distribution with sGRBs with known
redshifts, and found that our results are consistent with the observation,
which implies that our simulation results can reproduce the observed luminosity
distribution well.

consistently outperform the baseline models leveraging only vital signs and

become unreliable when used to classify whether a student would receive an A, B

"  We study a turbulent jet issuing from a cylindrical nozzle to characterise
coherent structures evolving in the turbulent boundary layer. The analysis is
performed using data from a large-eddy simulation of a Mach 0.4 jet. Azimuthal
decomposition of the velocity field in the nozzle shows that turbulent kinetic
energy predominantly resides in high azimuthal wavenumbers; the first three
azimuthal wavenumbers, that are important for sound generation, contain much
lower, but non-zero amplitudes. Using two-point statistics, low azimuthal modes
in the nozzle boundary layer are shown to exhibit significant correlations with
modes of same order in the free-jet region. Spectral Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition (SPOD) is used to distill a low-rank approximation of the flow
dynamics. This reveals the existence of tilted coherent structures within the
nozzle boundary layer and shows that these are coupled with wavepackets in the
jet. The educed nozzle boundary-layer structures are modelled using a local
linear stability analysis of the nozzle mean flow. Projection of the leading
SPOD modes on the stability eigenmodes shows that the organised boundary-layer
structures can be modelled using a small number of stable eigenmodes of the
boundary-layer branch of the eigenspectrum, indicating the prevalence of
non-modal effects. Finally local and global resolvent analysis of the mean-flow
are performed. It is shown that the most-energetic nozzle structures can be
successfully described with optimal resolvent response modes, whose associated
forcing modes are observed to tilt against the nozzle boundary-layer,
suggesting that the Orr mechanism underpins these organised, turbulent,

"  Controlling the thermal conductivity of semiconductors is of practical
interest in optimizing the performance of thermoelectric and phononic devices.
The insertion of inclusions of nanometer size in a semiconductor is an
effective means of achieving such control; it has been proposed that the
thermal conductivity of silicon could be reduced to 1 W/m/K using this approach
and that a minimum in the heat conductivity would be reached for some optimal
size of the inclusions. Yet the practical verification of this design rule has
been limited. In this work, we address this question by studying the thermal
properties of silicon metalattices that consist of a periodic distribution of
spherical inclusions with radii from 7 to 30 nm, embedded into silicon.
Experimental measurements confirm that the thermal conductivity of silicon
metalattices is as low as 1 W/m/K for silica inclusions, and that this value
can be further reduced to 0.16 W/m/K for silicon metalattices with empty pores.
A detailed model of ballistic phonon transport suggests that this thermal

of the periodic inhomogeneities. This study is a significant step in
elucidating the scaling laws that dictate ballistic heat transport at the

explained by the influence of dynamo-generated magnetic fields on the scale of

discussed where these meso-scale fields can lead to both drastically
overestimated and underestimated values of alpha compared with the kinematic

outward normal $\boldsymbol{n}_k$ is equal to $L_k$ for all $k=1,\dots,5$. Our
main result reads that $\mathscr{L}$ is not a locally-analytic set, i.\,e., we
prove that, for some point $(L_1,\dots,L_5)\in\mathscr{L}$, it is not possible
to find a neighborhood $U\subset\mathbb{R}^5$ and an analytic set
$A\subset\mathbb{R}^5$ such that $\mathscr{L}\cap U=A\cap U$. We interpret this
result as an obstacle for finding an existence theorem for a compact convex
polytope with prescribed directions and perimeters of the faces.

"  Lightning Network (LN) addresses the scalability problem of Bitcoin by
leveraging off-chain transactions. Nevertheless, it is not possible to run LN
on resource-constrained IoT devices due to its storage, memory, and processing
requirements. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient and secure
protocol that enables an IoT device to use LN's functions through a gateway LN
node. The idea is to involve the IoT device in LN operations with its digital
signature by replacing original 2-of-2 multisignature channels with 3-of-3
multisignature channels. Our protocol enforces the LN gateway to request the
IoT device's cryptographic signature for all operations on the channel. We
evaluated the proposed protocol by implementing it on a Raspberry Pi for a toll
payment scenario and demonstrated its feasibility and security.

"  This work presents a scenario of ultra-high energy cosmic ray source
distribution where a nearby source is solely responsible for the anisotropies
in arrival directions of cosmic rays while the rest of the sources contribute
only isotropically. An analytical approach focused on large-scale anisotropies,
which are influenced by deflections in a Kolmogorov-type turbulent magnetic
field, is employed to provide more general results. When the recent Pierre
Auger Observatory angular power spectrum above 8 EeV is used the restricted
model gives, under the assumption of the small angle approximation, a solution
where the RMS deflection with respect to the line of sight is $\alpha_{\rm rms}
= \left(50^{+11}_{-10}\right)^\circ$, while the relative flux from the single
source $\eta=0.03\pm 0.01$. Furthermore, the solution can be translated into
constraints on the source distance, luminosity, and extra-galactic magnetic
field strength. For Centaurus A and the Virgo cluster the required relation
between the coherence length and the RMS magnetic field strength is obtained: a
coherence length of $~\sim 100\,\mathrm{kpc}$ would imply the RMS field
strength around $1\,\mathrm{nG}$ for iron dominated and above $10\,\mathrm{nG}$
for proton dominated composition. We also performed trajectory simulations with
our publicly available code CRPropa to show that our analytical model can serve
as a good approximation as long as the deflections in cosmic magnetic fields
can be described as a random walk. The simulations showed that generally
structured fields tend to suppress large-scale anisotropies, especially the
dipole, compared to anisotropies at smaller scales described by higher
multipoles.

"  We present a means of characterizing and removing internal reflections
between the CCD and other optical surfaces in an astronomical camera. The
stellar reflections appear as out-of-focus images and are not necessarily
axisymmetric about the star. Using long exposures of very bright stars as
calibration images we are able to measure the position, size, and intensity of
reflections as a function of their position on the field. We also measure the
extended stellar point-spread function out to one degree. Together this
information can be used to create an empirical model of the excess light from
bright stars and reduce systematic artifacts in deep surface photometry. We
then reduce a set of deep observations of the Virgo cluster with our method to
demonstrate its efficacy and to provide a comparison with other strategies for
removing scattered light.

"  It is commonly adopted that X-rays from O stars are produced deep inside the
stellar wind, and transported outwards through the bulk of the expanding matter
which attenuates the radiation and affects the shape of emission line profiles.
None of the existing models was able to fit the observationed lines
consistently. The possible caveat of these models was the assumption of a
smooth stellar wind. Motivated by the various evidences that the stellar winds
are in fact structured, we present a 2-D numerical model of a stochastic,
inhomogeneous wind. Small parcels of hot, X-ray emitting gas are permeated with
cool, absorbing wind material which is compressed into thin shell fragments.
Wind fragmentation alters the radiative transfer drastically, compared to
homogeneous models of the same mass-loss rate. X-rays produced deep inside the
wind, which would be totally absorbed in a homogeneous flow, can effectively
escape from a fragmented wind. The wind absorption becomes wavelength
independent if the individual fragments are optically thick. The X-ray line
profiles are flat-topped in the blue part and decline steeply in the red part
for the winds with short acceleration zone. For the winds where the
acceleration extends over significant distances, the lines can appear nearly
symmetric and only slightly blueshifted, in contrast to the skewed, triangular
line profiles typically obtained from homogeneous wind models of high optical
depth. We show that profiles from a fragmented wind model can reproduce the
observed line profiles from zeta Orionis.

and Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method, we derive the existence of multi-peak

small, $2s<N<4s$, $1<p<2^*_s-1$ and some mild assumptions on the function $V$.
The main difficulties are from the nonlocal operator mixed the nonlocal term,
which cause the corresponding unperturbed problem turns out to be a system of
partial differential equations, but not a single fractional Kirchhoff equation.
In the second part, under some assumptions on $V$, we show the local uniqueness
of positive multi-peak solutions by using the local Pohoz\v{a}ev identity.

"  Most current approaches to metaphor identification use restricted linguistic
contexts, e.g. by considering only a verb's arguments or the sentence
containing a phrase. Inspired by pragmatic accounts of metaphor, we argue that
broader discourse features are crucial for better metaphor identification. We
train simple gradient boosting classifiers on representations of an utterance
and its surrounding discourse learned with a variety of document embedding
methods, obtaining near state-of-the-art results on the 2018 VU Amsterdam
metaphor identification task without the complex metaphor-specific features or
deep neural architectures employed by other systems. A qualitative analysis
further confirms the need for broader context in metaphor processing.

"  Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) possess novel properties which makes
them potential candidates for various spintronic applications. Heterostructures
of TMD with magnetic thin film have been extensively considered for
spin-orbital torque, enhancement of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy etc.
However, the effect of TMD on magnetic anisotropy in heterostructures of
in-plane magnetization has not been studied so far. Further the effect of the
TMD on the domain structure and magnetization reversal of the ferromagnetic
system is another important aspect to be understood. In this context we study
the effect of MoS2, a well-studied TMD material, on magnetic properties of
CoFeB in MoS2/CoFeB heterostructures. The reference CoFeB film possess a weak
in-plane anisotropy. However, when the CoFeB is deposited on MoS2 the in-plane
anisotropy is enhanced as observed from magneto optic Kerr effect (MOKE)
microscopy as well as ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). Magnetic domain structure
and magnetization reversal have also been significantly modified for the
MoS2/CoFeB bilayer as compared to the reference CoFeB layer. Frequency and
angle dependent FMR measurement show that the magnetic anisotropy of CoFeB
increases with increase in thickness of MoS2 in the MoS2/CoFeB
heterostructures.

"  In a recent paper [D. Dantchev, J. Bergnoff, and J. Rudnick, Phys. Rev. E 89,
042116 (2014)] the problem of the Casimir force in the $O(n)$ model on a slab
with free boundary conditions, investigated earlier by us [EPL 100, 10004
(2012)], is reconsidered using a mean spherical model with separate constraints
for each layer. The authors (i) question the applicability of the
Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson approach to the low-temperature regime, arguing for the
superiority of their model compared to the family of $\phi^4$ models A and B
whose numerically exact solutions we determined both for values of the coupling
constant $0<g<\infty$ and $g=\infty$. They (ii) report consistency of their
results with ours in the critical region and a strong manifestation of
universality, but (iii) point out discrepancies with our results in the region
below $T_{\mathrm{c}}$. We show here that (i) is unjustified and prove that our
model B with $g=\infty$ is identical to their spherical model. Hence evidence
for the reported universality is already contained in our work. Moreover, the
results we determined for anyone of the models A and B for various thicknesses
$L$ are all numerically exact. (iii) is due to their misinterpretation of our
results for the scaling limit. We also show that their low-temperature
expansion, which does not hold inside the scaling regime, is limited to
temperatures lower than they anticipated.

"  Ultraviolet self-interaction energies in field theory sometimes contain
meaningful physical quantities. The self-energies in such as classical
electrodynamics are usually subtracted from the rest mass. For the consistent
treatment of energies as sources of curvature in the Einstein field equations,
this study includes these subtracted self-energies into vacuum energy expressed
by the constant Lambda (used in such as Lambda-CDM). In this study, the
self-energies in electrodynamics and macroscopic classical Einstein field
equations are examined, using the formalisms with the ultraviolet cutoff
scheme. One of the cutoff formalisms is the field theory in terms of the
step-function-type basis functions, developed by the present authors. The other
is a continuum theory of a fundamental particle with the same cutoff length.
Based on the effectiveness of the continuum theory with the cutoff length shown
in the examination, the dominant self-energy is the quadratic term of the Higgs
field at a quantum level (classical self-energies are reduced to logarithmic
forms by quantum corrections). The cutoff length is then determined to
reproduce today's tiny value of Lambda for vacuum energy. Additionally, a field
with nonperiodic vanishing boundary conditions is treated, showing that the
field has no zero-point energy.

"  Deep neural networks may easily memorize noisy labels present in real-world
data, which degrades their ability to generalize. It is therefore important to
track and evaluate the robustness of models against noisy label memorization.
We propose a metric, called susceptibility, to gauge such memorization for
neural networks. Susceptibility is simple and easy to compute during training.
Moreover, it does not require access to ground-truth labels and it only uses
unlabeled data. We empirically show the effectiveness of our metric in tracking
memorization on various architectures and datasets and provide theoretical
insights into the design of the susceptibility metric. Finally, we show through
extensive experiments on datasets with synthetic and real-world label noise
that one can utilize susceptibility and the overall training accuracy to
distinguish models that maintain a low memorization on the training set and
generalize well to unseen clean data.

"  The disk around AB Aur was imaged and resolved at 24.6\,$\mu$m using the
Cooled Mid-Infrared Camera and Spectrometer on the 8.2m Subaru Telescope. The
gaussian full-width at half-maximum of the source size is estimated to be 90
$\pm$ 6 AU, indicating that the disk extends further out at 24.6\,$\mu$m than
at shorter wavelengths. In order to interpret the extended 24.6\,$\mu$m image,
we consider a disk with a reduced surface density within a boundary radius
$R_c$, which is motivated by radio observations that suggest a reduced inner
region within about 100 AU from the star. Introducing the surface density
reduction factor $f_c$ for the inner disk, we determine that the best match
with the observed radial intensity profile at 24.6\,$\mu$m is achieved with
$R_c$=88 AU and $f_c$=0.01. We suggest that the extended emission at
24.6\,$\mu$m is due to the enhanced emission from a wall-like structure at the
boundary radius (the inner edge of the outer disk), which is caused by a jump
in the surface density at $R_c$. Such reduced inner disk and geometrically
thick outer disk structure can also explain the more point-like nature at
shorter wavelengths. We also note that this disk geometry is qualitatively
similar to a pre-transitional disk, suggesting that the AB Aur disk is in a
pre-transitional disk phase.

centre (which lifts the centre in characteristic zero) together with a large
$p$-centre. Moreover, $Y_n(\sigma)$ is free as a module over its center. In
future work, it will be seen that every reduced enveloping algebra
$U_\chi(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ is Morita equivalent to a quotient of an appropriate
choice of shifted Yangian, and so our results will have applications in
classical representation theory.

"  We perform scanning photocurrent microscopy on WS2 ionic liquid-gated field

biasing the gate electrode we can invert the sign of the photocurrent showing
that the minority photocarriers are either electrons or holes. Both in the
electron- and the hole-doping regimes the photocurrent decays exponentially as
a function of the distance between the illumination spot and the nearest
contact, in agreement with a two-terminal Schottky-barrier device model. This
allows us to compare the value and the doping dependence of the diffusion
length of the minority electrons and holes on a same sample. Interestingly, the
diffusion length of the minority carriers is several times larger in the hole
accumulation regime than in the electron accumulation regime, pointing out an
electron-hole asymmetry in WS2.

"  Human pose transfer aims at transferring the appearance of the source person
to the target pose. Existing methods utilizing flow-based warping for non-rigid
human image generation have achieved great success. However, they fail to
preserve the appearance details in synthesized images since the spatial
correlation between the source and target is not fully exploited. To this end,
we propose the Flow-based Dual Attention GAN (FDA-GAN) to apply occlusion- and
deformation-aware feature fusion for higher generation quality. Specifically,
deformable local attention and flow similarity attention, constituting the dual
attention mechanism, can derive the output features responsible for deformable-
and occlusion-aware fusion, respectively. Besides, to maintain the pose and
global position consistency in transferring, we design a pose normalization
network for learning adaptive normalization from the target pose to the source
person. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art models in public iPER and DeepFashion datasets.
